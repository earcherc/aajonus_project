cheese is because when it goes in to your body it starts breaking up the
cheese and then causing your body to digest it, the problem that happens in
the blood is that if you have salt in there, of course your body will take the
sodium chloride or the sodium potassium, however you are getting the sodium
and separate it, isolate it because it is in rock form.",1.9726010346143805,Dangers_Of_Salt.txt,2023-12-06 17:26:04.131235

Geniuses and diet,"I don't even cheat

All raw foods I eat raw milk lots of raw eggs

raw meats chicken

fish

beef lamb

all of them

It reversed all of my diseases I did the raw food

Vegetarian fruitarian

program in my exploration experimentation for six and a half years

After six and a half years it started decomposing my bone and other tissue

That's when I found the raw meat because it was my only promise

The Eskimo before the Germans brought in cauldrons didn't cook a thing

99% of their diet was meat

animal products

They had absolutely no degenerative disease

The first degenerative disease and an Eskimo was found in a 50 year old man who had been living in a German colony

German and British colony eating man's white man's food, which was

lots of breads and sugars

He developed a

Dental carry they had no

Cavities not even cavities the first case of cancer in the Eskimos was until 1934

Then you take a look at the Maasai tribe in Africa

nothing, but raw milk raw blood fresh mixed together equal portions and

raw meats

They are considered the healthiest tallest strongest smartest tribe in the world

They know vegetation

Now because I was not raised a raw footer

I was very toxic and very sick, and I was very sickly as a child so by the time I was 19

I had developed my cancer of the stomach

And went from there, so what I found was my blood gets very acidic

So to counterbalance that what I do is have four cups of green vegetable juice a day

About 60 percent 60 to 80 percent celery 20 percent parsley, and I will use summer squash

like zucchini or

Cucumber or the funny-looking 50s flying saucer looking

squash and

that in between

My meals and I keep it very methodical.",2.0726360036311915,Cancer_Convention_September_2000.txt,2023-12-06 17:26:07.223631

Geniuses and diet,"but the raw cream for the brain raw cream is a little bit more important

lots of raw eggs, lots of meat

what I do is I go to a lot of breakfasts like early breakfasts like 7 a.m. and

you know what I've generally been getting is salad you know the romaine lettuce and

tomatoes with lemon then I have to according to you know once I need a

salad I shouldn't eat for five hours just thought that's pretty good now it

doesn't get nasty get far enough ahead then nothing else okay first of all I'd

like to know a little bit more about that because sometimes you know I'm

coming out of that meeting and I only time I'm gonna have to eat is then so

I'm eating maybe I'm asking myself whether I should eat at the two or three

hour point and if I do choose to eat then what kind of damage am I doing

rather than if I wait to five hours that's the first part of my question the

second part of the question is what kind of a salad can I start eating at these

7 a.m. breakfast meetings where I can not have to go to this five-hour thing

I'm thinking like avocado tomato onion

can I use how much farther can I go like a cucumber with no skin or is that

getting into five hours that thing green onions regular onions can you give me

some shit some insight on how I can create this salad look what's a little

information about the about what it just more more information about the five-hour

and what I'm pushing and what I'm doing if I'm eating before the 5 a.m. period.",2.19921774733257,"Q&A_Of_August_17,_2003_(Full).txt",2023-12-06 17:26:07.224172

and you're going to have small amounts of it even with me but it's uh you know still it's still

fiber can I add anything there's a little bit it's okay but I can have as many tomatoes and

avocados is there anything else I can add to that at all a little bit of cilantro or not much not

much you can you know if you do that and if you have a salad down a lot of eggs

about three hours later two and a half three hours later okay and babies are

going to absorb you know a few minutes after they leave the job but no more

than an hour no more than three or four hours out earlier than three or four
