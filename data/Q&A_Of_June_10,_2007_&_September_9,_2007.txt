(1) Aajonus Eye Sight Started Going
[2006]

Oh, another thing that happened, when this accident happened my eyesight started going for about two months because of all the nutrients that it took to heal all of this wound

So, it was borrowing from everywhere, not just this leg.

As soon as the cast started going away, the muscle in the leg redeveloped.

As the cast went away, the muscles came back.

I mean, it was just like a miracle, it's like shapeshifting, my first experience like that.

Cause I looked at my leg after a week and a half and I just had this bone here and this sagging flesh.

It was disgusting.

But I trusted the process, it was good.

.

(2) Adrenaline Makes Aajonus Angry
[2006],[Attendee]

You must've got a pretty good adrenaline rush in that panic kind of situation

[Aajonus]

No, I try to keep that down because adrenaline causes me to get angry, and might cause me to be a little short in my respect?

Like that young intern, oh my God, you're crazy.

I mean, that's in bad shape and he just would- and if I had taken offense to that.

And if I had had a high adrenaline, I might have taken a high offense to that as I would in my earlier days.

[Attendee #2]

Especially since they just walked away.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, I just said, these are sad people, you know, they can just jump out in the street like that and then stand there and I'm coming at them and, you know, I hit, if they had jumped outta the way, would've been different, but they just froze like a deer with lights in their eyes.

[Attendee #2]

So, they didn't even look.

[Aajonus]

They didn't even look, they just jumped right into the street as if they were the only people on the- of course, I was slightly on the left side of the road cause I wanted to allow cars to go past me, you know?

So, they weren't paying attention to this end side of the road?

.

(3) Always Changed To Be Made, Re Read Book
[2007]

First thing I wanna say is that when you go on this diet, the primal diet, remember there's always adjustments to make

Even if I put you on a diet and you go through some changes and you're going through certain kinds of detoxes and you have certain symptoms, you look up in the book the symptoms that you are having, and that's what you do.

Now, you may not have the disease, but you have the symptoms.

If you want to be able to access that quickly, the best thing to do is to go to https://www.

wewant2live.

com/ and get the downloaded books.

That way you can plug right into it on search and find on a PDF file, the Adobe reader file.

That's the easiest way to do it.

The quickest.

You don't have to go through an index.

You don't do all of that.

Of course the indexes in the books are okay, are pretty good.

I had the latest version of We Want To Live, it has the primal diet on the cover.

I had a professional couple who do indexes, they did it.

So, it's pretty thorough.

However, it's quicker to access if you're in a pinch and not feeling well and having some symptoms, it's always better to access it on your computer and get if the answers a little bit quicker, as quickly as possible.

But there always adjustments to make a lot of people say, well, you know, I got on the diet, I did great for a year, year and a half.

And you know, I keep doing the same things or I've adjusted it.

And if you're not doing well on it, it means you're not making the proper adjustments for your changes.

So reread the books.

A lot of people think one read through is okay.

I have students that I had read it up to 16 times and for each reread, they got as much out of it as they did the first time.

Because there's a lot of things that don't register until you experience it, and that's many years of experience in there.

So, don't think that you have it down just because you've read the book once or twice, I recommend the people read it every 6 to 12 months, one read through in each book.

.

(4) Animal Fats Dont Cause Heart Disease
[2007],[Aajonus]

When it has to clean the body out, it gets jammed

It starts collecting all of the hardened fats, especially all of those hydrogenated vegetable oils or vegetable oils in general.

Vegetable oils in the human body crystallize.

That's what causes hardening of our heart and arteries, not animal fat.

That's a myth, a fiction.

An herbivore that eats vegetables and vegetable oil in their vegetables have a body temperature of 101° to 105°.

Ours is 98.

6° and lower.

So, when we eat vegetable oils, if it's made a part of a cell, it will store in the body and crystallize over about a year to five-year period.

And once it's crystallized, you cannot get it dissolved unless you can get the body temperature high enough.

And that's 102° to 105°.

So, you have to stay in it that long before it gets deep enough to get into those lymph glands and lymph nodes.

It takes an hour to get there.

Well, it takes about 50 minutes to get there.

So, an hour you've spent 10 minutes starting to dissolve some of it melt some of it.

You stay in a full hour and a half and you've melted at least a thousand of an inch.

That's not much, but you figure each time you take a layer and dissolve it, you're going to melt it and get it out of your body.

You're gonna start relieving it from the body.

Otherwise, you're not.

Your lymphatic system will stay congested for your entire life.

I don't care what diet you're on.

Even if you're on this diet.

I don't care if you do trampoline for the lymphatic system or what, it will not move if it's hardened.

It has to be softened.

It has to be softened.

So, what you do is before you get in the bath, like it says in the book, you make it have a combination of pineapple, coconut cream, a tiny bit of dairy cream, a tiny bit of butter and a little bit of honey.

And you blend that all together and you drink it right before you get into the bath or as soon as you get into the bath.

Then when you get out of the bath in an hour to an hour and a half, you get out of the bath, you're gonna feel like a wet noodle, a limp noodle and you're not gonna wanna move very fast, and you wanna keep that door closed cause you want that bathroom to stay hot and you wanna towel off gradually.

Then you wanna dress with winter clothes, I don't care how hot it is, and then you take a 45-minute walk.

By the time you are taking that walk, that pineapple coconut mixture is going to be in your lymphatic system.

Moving in there while that little bit of lymph space is still fluid.

So, when it moves in there, it can't harden when your body reaches 98.

6° and lower again, it will not harden.

It'll keep that little space, that little fine little area fluid.

You don't do any more than two a week.

Some people should, if you're very thin, you you shouldn't do any until you put on weight and you have to be at least 10, 15 pounds overweight before you do those.

Because when that stuff dumps into the system, you better have enough fat to protect you.

If you're dumping something like mercury or Thallium or lead into that tissue.

If you don't have the fats in the tissue, you are going to be damaged.

And what happens if you damage your connective tissue.

You're either going to develop lupus or Ms?

Not a pretty picture.

So, you've got to have at least 10, 15 pounds overweight before you do those hot baths.

Once you start doing them, you can do two a week.

Never closer than three days apart.

So, if you went on the same day of the weeks as the same days of the week, say you do it on Monday and then you do it on Thursday.

It should be done between 1:30 and 4:30 in the afternoon.

So, you do one on a weekend or if you can only do in the afternoon on the weekends, you just do it one day a week on the weekend.

Then each day you can do a 35-to-40-minute bath and you don't have the pineapple coconut cream mixture.

You don't need that.

That 35-to-40-minute bath is to relieve the toxins that have dumped from the lymphatic system in the connective tissue to perspire it out of the body or pull it out of the skin, so it doesn't collect in there.

.

(5) Antibiotic Formula
(6) Aspartame 11 Names
[2007],[Aajonus]

Chewing gum, aspartame and that kind of thing

[Attendee]

No, it's none of that.

[Aajonus]

Sure it isn't.

[Attendee]

Xylitol.

That's all.

[Aajonus]

They have got 11 names for Aspartame, and if you wanna know every name, no 9 names for Aspartame and some of them they're calling it natural because they wash it.

They're calling it clean and natural and good for health in, people.

So look it up the 9 names for Aspartame.

Find out what they are because they're on almost everything.

[Attendee]

So just concerning the beeswax, I'm just wondering it has any health properties.

[Aajonus]

Yes.

It helps the skin immensely.

The hydrochloric acid dissolves it and it helps the skin, helps protects the ears.

It helps do a lot of things, protects the eyes.

[Attendee]

So, you just swallow it.

[Aajonus]

You chew it and if it gets too dry, just put a little butter in your mouth with it?

[Attendee]

And you swallow it at the end.

[Aajonus]

Swallow it, yeah?

[Attendee]

It just breaks up gradually as you eat it.

[Aajonus]

Not for some people, some people don't have the right proper enzymes in their mouth?

But you have a good mouth.

You have good activity in your mouth.

You have good bacteria and enzymes in your mouth.

.

(7) Bath Too Hot At 110
[2007],[Attendee]

Did like 110°

Is that okay.

Or is that ideal?

[Aajonus]

It's not a good idea?

110 is pretty hot.

You're gonna start cooking the enzymes and vitamins in your skin.

[Attendee]

So, what's the max temperature.

[Aajonus]

105?

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

105

Yeah.

There's a misprint in the first book.

In fact, all the way up until this last printing, there's a misprint.

It says 110°.

It should be at top 105°.

[Kathy]

How do you know if it's gonna be 105.

[Aajonus]

You can have a thermometer?

.

(8) Brain Damage and Hyperative - Fish and Cream
[2007],[Aajonus]

She had a head injury, a year ago was it

[Attendee]

Yes?

[Aajonus]

And her brain is hyperactive and she wanted to know how to calm it.

And I suggested fish and cream together, not a lot of cream, but fish and cream together.

Don't sit down and drink a half a cup with your fish, cuz it's gonna coat your fish and you won't digest it.

But you could use like three tablespoons with a fish meal and drinking like a tablespoon of cream about every two hours is going to help protect the brain.

Remember cream protects the brain and nervous system butter does not.

I said every hour and a half.

[Kathy]

About the corn on your feet.

[Aajonus]

I don't have any corn on my feet.

[Kathy]

I mean, anybody that does use it's in the book.

It says that you should use papaya.

Right now they have the orange papaya, which is with a lot of seeds and the black seeds, of course would take out the seeds.

We're not gonna coat our foot with that.

It says about once a week.

Now, also I soak my feet in that soap.

Do I need to keep doing that every week, putting it on the oil.

It's olive oil and papaya.

[Aajonus]

Now, are you talking about a corn, are you talking about wart.

What are you talking about?

[Kathy]

The corn under your foot?

And then I also was last week.

I was not supposed to put my feet in soapy water, but cuz I had lime on it instead of putting coconut cream on it.

[Aajonus]

What's your question.

[Kathy]

Well, I wanna know, do I put it on both feet, papaya and olive oil because olive oil will help?

[Aajonus]

Do you have a corn on both feet.

[Kathy]

No, just this one?

[Aajonus]

Well, then why would you put it on both.

Remember I told you to do it for maybe four times?

[Kathy]

Four times a day.

[Aajonus]

I said put what and clay?

[Kathy]

Clay and papaya?

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Clay and papaya.

You coat the foot with it.

That's right.

You use the moisturizer.

You do that every day for four days.

[Kathy]

I didn't hear four days.

It wasn't on my tape.

[Aajonus]

That's when your tape ended and you turned it over.

Probably pretty much absorbs into the skin, so you just take some time to get out.

[Kathy]

So, I could start for four days again.

[Aajonus]

You could try it?

.

(9) Bringing Milk On Plane and Eggs
[2007],[Attendee]

What do you do

[Aajonus]

If you want to get beyond that, you take quite a few little small three ounce bottles?

You can have six or seven of them as long as they fit into a one-quart ziplock bag.

So, three ounces of milk.

[Attendee]

Can I put two eggs in each.

[Aajonus]

You can do that?

Yeah.

[Attendee #2]

What if you wanna bring food for your trip.

Like some ceviche or some butter, and now they're getting some stricter and not even letting you take?

They confiscated my ceviche last time, six months before that they didn't.

[Aajonus]

Well, if it's wet and liquid, they're gonna take it.

Anything that's like at all, wet.

[Attendee #2]

Anything that's like at all wet, yogurt.

[Attendee]

So, you can't bring milk.

[Aajonus]

You can take milk in a three ounce container, many three ounce containers?

[Attendee]

Check the cooler.

[Aajonus]

No, cuz the radiation is very heavy in those machines?

[Attendee]

So, is there any way around it.

Letter?

Doctor?

[Aajonus]

Yes?

You can have a doctor's letter.

I take a whole half a gallon every time I go.

But I've got a doctor's letter.

[Attendee #2]

He told me, I don't care if you have a doctor's, this is as much as you can eat on the plane.

That's it.

That's what he said.

[Aajonus]

Well, I tell them I eat two quarts on the plane.

I'll say I'm diabetic, I was diagnosed as diabetic.

That's what my doctor's letter said.

It doesn't say I still have diabetes.

It says I was diagnosed as diabetic.

So, he asked to eat every hour.

[Attendee #2]

They let you bring in larger containers.

[Aajonus]

I'll take two of these and I'll take two of these?

I have my bag and I take it out and hand my doctor's letter.

[Attendee #2]

Did they x-ray did it.

[Aajonus]

Most of the time they don't?

[Attendee]

Do you take your green drink and your meat.

[Aajonus]

I usually have my green drink in the morning?

[Attendee]

Do you take your eggs whole and the egg shells.

[Aajonus]

They say are these hard boiled?

And I say they're as hard as I want them?

[Attendee]

What if they weren't hardboiled, what would they care.

[Aajonus]

Cause it's liquid?

I know they're stupid.

They are really ridiculous.

[Attendee #2]

Have you had good success.

I mean, most of the time?

[Aajonus]

When I leave Los Angeles I would say 75% of the time they don't scan my food?

They never take my food away from me.

They don't wanna be responsible for a diabetic incident.

There's no way they want be responsible for a diabetic.

[Attendee]

I should use mine to my advantage to get a note for my doctor that I'm diabetic.

[Attendee #2]

But you're not a diabetic.

[Aajonus]

No, no, no?

My doctor said I was diagnosed as diabetic.

[Attendee]

I could say the same thing.

[Aajonus]

Right?

Were you taking insulin at some time.

Were you diabetic?

Were you diagnosed as diabetic?

Okay?

I was, I took insulin from 15.

5 to 20.

No, I'm not anymore.

[Attendee #3]

So, what about people who have never been diabetic.

Is there another solution?

[Aajonus]

Little small bottles?

That's it.

[Attendee]

When I was there last time, I've got real problems.

So, I bring a note from the doctor.

He said no way.

He said, I don't care what you bring, you're not taking it.

[Aajonus]

These are lackies.

You get supervisor.

[Attendee]

I've had to change airports and I have what I need and I've had it all taken from me.

And I've asked for supervisors and I've said, I'm diabetic.

[Aajonus]

You have to take a letter.

[Attendee]

I can try to, but I'm afraid after all this happening, I'm afraid that, that the letter won't mean anything.

[Aajonus]

It works for everybody I know that takes a letter.

[Attendee]

Let's just say that we can't take anything on the plane.

Any suggestions to help us get through a long plane way.

[Aajonus]

You can take your three ounce bottles?

As long as what you have fits in a ziploc quart bottle, you can take as many as you want.

[Attendee]

You can't have it done x-ray though.

[Aajonus]

No, they'll have to have an x-ray, but when you put it through the x-ray, you let everything go through, everything behind it?

You wait until your food has gone through.

You hold up the line.

[Attendee]

What do you mean.

[Aajonus]

Because if they've got a bag in front that they're going to sit and look at for two minutes and decide whether they're going to inspect it and your food's right behind it, that's gonna get bombarded?

So you let that pass through.

And if he's sitting and waiting, you know that that's the last one.

Then you put your food on there when he starts it up again, your food's gonna go through and they'll just pass through cause there won't be any metal.

[Attendee]

I always thought I was nuts for doing that.

[Aajonus]

No, that's what I do.

And then after I know that he's okayed it nothing goes on that.

My next luggage doesn't go on that belt until I know he's okayed it and it's passing through and the belt's moving.

Yeah, but there's metal on the control.

One important thing.

[Attendee]

I put it in my big suitcase that I checked and put it in coolers and packed it well, and randomly they choose maybe every fourth one to unzip, and look at, which mine has been that, and they've even found all my grapes.

I've checked a lot of food and gotten it through.

It's just on the plane.

[Aajonus]

Then you've got high, high radiation.

[Attendee]

It's higher there than it is in the.

[Aajonus]

Oh, it's extremely high?

[Attendee]

I have a Cola that I make and I can check it in as luggage, and I tell 'em it says food.

[Aajonus]

Yes.

You have to do that, and you have to do that at the desk, at the desk.

That's what I do when I go to China, when I'm taking 30 pounds of butter and all kinds of other things with me.

[Attendee]

You take a cooler.

Is that what you said.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, I take a cooler?

And then I go to the desk and I say, I need you to hand check this, and pass it through.

[Attendee]

So, the radiation's not in the plane where the luggage department is.

[Aajonus]

No, it's the, x-ray, big huge machine they have?

I mean, it puts out like 50 x-rays worth in one shot as your luggage passes through.

So, if you've got any food in that, it's highly radioactively charge, your mineral's in it.

[Attendee]

I'm a part of a small team.

Main team comes in from Tokyo.

We treat mostly physicians who have less than eight or nine days to live.

They've already had chemo.

They've had radiation, they've had surgery that really need to be carried in, and so I have to go through this with this young lady every time I go through the airport and I do ask for the supervisor.

If he hassles me, I take heavy weight, a little foil and wrap it into exactly what you say, clear the dead, let him run through and it seems to work each time.

And I mean, it may hassle them, but what seems to do the most is when the line backs up.

They don't like the pressure from the line.

So they usually say, okay, let's go.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends upon, some personalities and some people can get it through easily.

Always ask for a supervisor.

Cause the lackies are told and these are lackies.

They have no brains.

If you have a brain, you're not in TSA.

Seems to be a rule.

So, you have to get a supervisor to get any, but most of 'em will tell you no, unless you have a letter.

So, your safe way is just little three ounce bottles if you want to take your liquid.

They're just gonna think it's shampoo.

[Attendee]

Are they plastic or not plastic though.

Some are glass?

[Aajonus]

Glass is nice if you can get glass.

[Attendee]

But there is metal on top.

[Aajonus]

That's fine.

[Attendee]

Is plastic alright.

[Aajonus]

Well it's okay for a short trip?

Well, it doesn't show up as something alarming.

.

(10) Can Teeth Regenerate Like Bone
[2007],[Attendee]

Can teeth regenerate the way bone can

[Aajonus]   She asked, can teeth regenerate the way bone can?

No?

Not in my experience.

I've only found it happen with two people that were under 25.

One had a huge cavity and they didn't have it filled, and within six months of starting to drink raw milk, it filled in.

The whole tooth.

The tubule filled in and then the dentine grew back.

Now, I've had teeth where- it's only been in the last six years that I have fillings that the body starts growing back.

The facials start growing the tubules.

It'll grow, it'll take that composite filling and grow it out.

So, it's got all these edges on it and I have to keep having it drilled down and filed down because the tubule is now growing, 60 years old.

So, now it's finally come to that.

I'm healthy enough.

[Kathy]   It can grow back if you are on the diet long enough.

[Aajonus]   If you're on the diet long enough, it's probably very possible depending upon how severe the damage is that you sustained, and my teeth were a mess from chemo and radiation.

I'm lucky I got the bone back around my teeth because after radiation therapy, I lost all the bone around my teeth.

So, my teeth dangled in my gums like this.

So, if I bit down on my own teeth, I lost about a half a cup of blood at a time.

Couldn't stop the bleeding.

So, what I did was I blended my donuts in RC Cola and then drank it with a thick straw.

That's where I was then, I didn't know any better.

But then when I started drinking raw milk, within a year and a half of drinking the raw milk on a daily basis about anywhere from a half a gallon to a gallon a day, my bone around my teeth all restored.

.

(11) Cant Gain Weight
[2007],[Attendee]

Well, I guess I have a problem of not being able to gain weight

I can lose 15 pounds or 12 pounds in two weeks, and then it'll take seven years to get fat.

I'm still not at my regular weight.

[Aajonus]

Well, that's an indication you're not digesting well.

So, take two days and eat lots of eggs.

Eat like 40 eggs a day for two days, and then when you eat the regular diet in my recipe book.

The one where there's just two meat meals a day and you make that moisturizing formula.

It's called the moisturizing lubrication formula.

For women it's moisturizing, for men it's lubrication.

Make two of those, make a double batch and have a third of it after each meat meal and a third during the night.

You will gain weight, I promise.

.

(12) Cataracts
[2007],[Attendee]

What about cataracts

[Aajonus]

Cataracts?

That'll help cataracts?

I would use both.

[Kathy]

Both what.

[Aajonus]

Coconut cream and the lime juice and I would alternate them using the egg white in the eyes with cataracts?

[Attendee]

So, the egg white, how do you use that.

[Aajonus]

I eat the rest of the egg white, I'm eating eggs all day long?

[Attendee]

Okay, well some of us can't eat eggs all day long.

[Aajonus]

If I do it, I eat an egg.

I use it and then eat the egg.

That's it.

Then the next time I eat another egg, I can do it again if I want.

[Attendee #2]

Yep.

That's what I do.

[Aajonus]

Well, then I would suggest you take one of those little one ounce or half ounce little containers, put a little egg white in there and close it.

Keep it from oxidizing.

[Attendee]

What about keratoconus.

Same thing?

Egg white or?

[Aajonus]

I would use a combination for that because that's always a scarring?

[Kathy]

What is that.

[Aajonus]

It's a scarring of the inner layer of the cornea or right on the Iris itself?

[Attendee #3]

I've got an egg white method I've been using for the last few months.

What I do is before I go to bed and when I get up in the middle of the night, I always use the eggs.

I get an eight ounce jar.

I crack the eggs in the jar.

I stick my fingers in the egg white, and I just keep my eyes open and I just rub it all over.

Kind of keep 'em slip and I down the egg.

And then when I get up in three or four hours, I do the same thing, I do an egg and I stick my fingers in there.

I just keep my eyes open a slit and down the egg, it's much faster than doing that Aajonus.

I could never get around to that.

[Aajonus]

But most people won't like that egg white all over their eyelashes and everything.

[Attendee #3]

I'm single, I live alone.

[Aajonus]

So, they're not worried about your cakey white cause you will have that.

[Attendee #3]

I have that, but it comes off in the shower.

.

(13) Cheese & Honey, Tumor From Mineral Ssupplements
[2007],[Lewis]

Whenever you eat it they should both be in the mouth together

[Aajonus]

If you want to absorb the minerals and the fats in it and the protein?

If you don't, if you want it to be a sponge and a magnet for toxins, you don't eat it with honey.

You just eat it alone, but that doesn't mean you can't eat it with a meal.

It'll still act like that with a meal.

The honey's the only thing that will convert that cheese into something to digest.

We're talking about raw cheese here.

Pasteurized cheese is already fractionated.

You're going to absorb those minerals, even though they cauterized, and they're gonna do some damage in your system.

For the first time I had a patient who had a tumor that had very little chemical in it.

He had a lot of DMSO in it, cuz he used to take that DMSO chemical and it's sold as something really good.

So he had DMSO in it, plus it had tons of magnesium, phosphorus and potassium.

Off the charts in those minerals, but very low on calcium comparatively.

And he had taken supplements galore, mineral supplements.

Of course, these were cauterized minerals, so his body couldn't use them.

So, he created this huge tumor and when it was finally removed and I had it analyzed those were the results of it.

First tumor that I'd had analyzed it didn't have some kind of heavy industrial compound in it, chemical or heavy metal.

It had no heavy metals, it had all the light metals and way too many of them.

[Attendee]

Why was he taking DMSO in the first place.

[Aajonus]

I think he was warding off arthritis or rheumatism, something like that?

And that was like 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

[Kathy]

He's okay now.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, he's okay now?

.

(14) Cheese and Honey For Minerals
(15) Cheese In A Magnet
[2007],[Aajonus]

Now the cheese is medicinal

You lose the ability to digest it, but it acts as a magnet.

Even starts in the mouth as your bloodstream, your neurological system, and your lymph system moves throughout the entire intestinal walls and digestive tract walls, the cheese acts as a magnet, and will draw poisons out of those three fluid systems.

[2007],[Attendee]

Is there something called chemtrails or something like that planes release flying over places

[Aajonus]

Yes?

[Attendee]

Can you tell me about that.

[Aajonus]

It's not a subject that I like to get into here, cuz it's a very complex one and the US government is bombing us and is spreading their waste products from industrial military development over us?

It's got aluminum, it's got all kinds of- barium, other waste products from developing military weapons.

They have nowhere to store it anymore, so they're bombing it all over the place.

[Attendee]

So, the whole United States is like getting it pretty much.

[Aajonus]

When I was in Thailand in February and the US military was there?

The US military goes to Thailand every year and does exercises with them and teaches them how to be good military people.

And they were bombing there for the first time chemtrailing that whole area.

Taught 'em how to chemtrail.

So, it's happening all over.

It's all over Europe, all over Europe.

These big military machines, they have to have somewhere to dump their poisons, so they dump it on their own population.

They have to spread it all over.

They're doing it everywhere.

[Attendee]

They can't bury it.

[Aajonus]

They're trying to thin it out everywhere, and there's so many people that it's okay to damage?

The casualty rate is 500 out of 10,000.

That's an acceptable loss that the military and the government considers okay.

.

(19) Chlorine, How To Detox
[2007],[Attendee]

We took our child for swimming lessons this summer

I was just wondering if there's anything you can do before or after the pool that would help mitigate like all the chlorine and all the chemicals in the water.

[Aajonus]

Chlorine?

There's no way you can get around it.

You got chloroform vapors.

That's the worst.

[Attendee]

It was an outdoor pool.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't make any difference, when your head is this close to the water, unless you've got a hell of a wind.

It is going to get into your system.

There's no way around it.

You can always put olive oil, butter, or coconut cream on your skin or coconut oil on the skin to protect your skin from absorbing the chlorine, but you have to understand chlorine is meant to dissolve.

The greatest mineral in our hydrochloric acid is chlorine.

So, chlorine eats away at things, so if you're gonna be in the one of the swimming pools, never going in indoor one.

You're just asking for a lot of lung and sinus and brain toxicity.

So, if you're in an outdoor one and there's a breeze, eh you're going to get some toxicity, it's gonna plant the ears.

That's why swimmers have so many ear conditions and sore throats and sinus problems, cuz of all that chloroform that they're breathing in, just remember chloroform transforms into formaldehyde in the human body often.

So, formaldehyde is a very toxic substance.

So, swimming pools is not a good thing.

[Attendee]

Primal Facial beforehand.

[Aajonus]

Primal Facial's probably not a good one to do?

You want something heavy oil.

Like the butter or olive oil or coconut oil.

Something that's gonna really cake, and chlorine's gonna take a long time to eat through that oil.

[Attendee]

But nothing you could do for the vapors.

[Aajonus]

Nothing you can do for the vapors?

Well, you can eat something to help get rid of it, but that what's planted in the brain is not gonna be easy to get rid of.

Those vapors are so finite even if you let's say put some cotton with some oil on and if you're breathing through it, it will filter out some of it and those oils will arrest some of it, but it won't be easy.

As soon as you get water in that cotton, you're not gonna be able to breathe and they're gonna come out anyway.

So, there's really no way to keep cotton balls up there in your nose to help filter it out with some oil on it.

But if you want to get rid of formaldehyde and the toxicity from the chloroform.

You take a half of a mango, a green mango, a tart mango, one kiwi, a tablespoon of honey, about four tablespoons of coconut cream, tablespoon of dairy cream, blend that all together, you can even put, let's say a teaspoon of lemon in with it also.

Blend that together and then eat that that'll help get rid of formaldehyde and chloroform from the body.

[Barbara]

Can I get back to the dog.

Cuz you said the dog had that rash and you said it was from formaldehyde from the vaccines?

[Aajonus]

It will probably give the dog some diarrhea, but that's okay.

[Barbara]

Because the rash is just getting bigger.

[Attendee]

Is there anything you would recommend.

Like my association, I went to them and said, can you not put the chlorine in?

And they said, sure, give us a better solution?

So, I don't know what is better.

[Aajonus]

Yes, you get the salt chlorinators.

It's electric, they're called electrical chlorinators.

What it is is you put salt, like rock salt, just sea salt, rock salt is sea salt.

It's not cleaned.

It's not sterilized like your table salt is, and then chlorine added to it.

So, you just put that rock salt in the pool, and it sends electrical charge through it and it converts some of that salt into chlorine that is non chloroform vapor producing it.

[Attendee]

Is it okay for the skin as well.

[Aajonus]

It's great?

My landlord just built a pool down here and I that's where I go swim now.

.

(20) Coconut Cream While Swimming
[2007],[Aajonus]

No, still water dries out the skin

So, you still want something on the skin.

[Kathy]

Like coconut cream.

[Aajonus]

Like coconut cream?

Coconut cream is not all that as heavy and that's a nicer thing to use.

Nicer for the skin because the coconut cream has water soluble vitamins and minerals, as well as the oil soluble and oil in the coconut cream is only 5% of the coconut cream.

.

(21) Cold Cream Is Fine
[2007],[Aajonus]

Want to drink a cold dairy product

Cream is fine, cuz it doesn't make any difference?

The hydrochloric acid doesn't need do anything with the fat.

That's all in duodenum already because the that's where the body shoots bile into the fat is in the duodenum.

So, you don't have to worry about eating cream cold.

That's fine.

.

(22) Cold Meat With Milk
[2007],[Fred]

What if you eat cold meat, can he drink the warm milk on top or do you have to wait

[Aajonus]

He should wait?

[Fred]

How long.

[Aajonus]

Probably 20, 30 minutes?

[Fred]

That long.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

.

(23) Cooking, Pasteurized Milk, Vitamin D
[2007],[Aajonus]

Cooking at 141° destroys 50% of the calcium, just at 141°

So, that's why pasteurization was so bad.

Now that the pasteurization is up around 169° to 170°, so almost 90% of the calcium is destroyed.

And do you know what they do with pasteurized milk.

They get mined calcium, mined calcium, and they shovel it into the tanks and then stirred up in there because when they pasteurize and skim the milk and treat it nowadays, it turns blue?

So, they put the calcium also in it to turn it white.

The vitamin D that they add to it is hydrogenated vegetable oils, which is plastic, and they irradiate it with ultra violent lights and call that vitamin D.

Doesn't have any relationship to vitamin D, but you can convince any politician.

You say, oh, sun rays, radiation touches fat in the body, turns it into vitamin D.

So, we'll make vitamin D by taking fat and irradiating it.

That is their thinking.

And people buy it, people accept it.

So, all that vitamin D is completely toxic.

It's irradiated plastic, and then they just sell you that this milk is good.

This pasteurized milk is good.

.

(24) Cottage Cheese
[2007],[Fred]

Does cottage cheese count as cheese, or is that more like a kefir

[Aajonus]

It's more like a cheese?

[Fred]

So, the same thing applies to cottage cheese.

[Aajonus]

Right?

It's just that because some of it's fluid in it, you will have some bioactive enzymes in cottage cheese that you won't have in dried cheese.

.

(25) Dehydrated Meat
[2007],[Attendee]

Dehydrating the meat a little

[Aajonus]

Okay.

If you dehydrate the meat, you lose your enzymes and a lot of the ability to utilize your proteins and digest in general.

[Attendee #2]

So, beef jerky is bad.

[Aajonus]

Beef jerky is terrible?

But if he wants to let his meat dry a little bit, it's not going to be that bad.

Just eat a little honey with it, to add some enzymes.

Yeah, they'll just leave it out on a plate.

They do that a lot done a lot in Pangai, in Hawaii.

A lot of the people don't like the fresh tasting meat.

They like it slightly dried.

[Attendee]

You could run a fan over it right.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

But still, when you're dehydrating, you're losing the electromagnetic energy, the field of energy of that food.

It's like the Indians every year, the Eskimos and the Inuit and the Canadian Indians will make a pemmican.

They'll dry meat, beat it until it becomes a flour and then mix it with some kind of a lard, whether it's some buffalo, seal, whatever they have available, and they bake it in the sun till it melts together, and then they press it into a 90 pound cube, and they will keep that throughout the whole winter incase they can't find any food for the hunt.

If they don't need to eat it, whatever they don't eat during the winter, they bury it in the spring.

They don't eat it.

Even though they've gone to all this great length to have this dry meat and go through this whole process, it is just for survival.

They know that it will leach enzymes and lots of properties out of the body and will weaken the body.

So, they bury it.

They will not eat it.

They only eat it if they're starving.

.

(26) Difficulty Eatign Raw Meat, Voer Alkaline
[2007],[Attendee]

So, I would like to ask you, is there a connection between emergency knee and a pH balance in the body

[Aajonus]   The what and the pH?

[Attendee]   I've been having difficulty eating the raw meat?

I'm very repulsed by it, and I wondered if there was a connection between the pH of the body, alkaline/acid that would possibly cause that because some days I can eat the meat with no trouble and then the next day or two I'm just repulsed by it.

[Aajonus]   When the bloodstream or the intestines gets over alkanalized it causes a neutralizing of the acid digestive juices in the intestines.

So, you won't be able to digest the meat as well.

[Attendee]   Well, how do I.

[Aajonus]   Well, you need to reduce the amount of fruit that you're eating to almost nothing?

Have no more than 12 ounces of vegetable juice a day and break it up into three, four ounces at a time, and then you shouldn't have a problem.

People who have that problem eat too much fruit or they drink too much vegetable juice.

The over alkanalizes the intestines.

.

(27) Eggs For Ernergy After Workout
[2007],[Attendee]

I go to gym before I go to work, and can you tell me a little bit good to regain some energy quickly

[Aajonus]   Before, or after the gym?

[Attendee]   After exercise I'm pretty tired?

Then I have to go to work because that's my schedule.

[Aajonus]   I would say down five eggs.

You saw Rocky.

Okay, he breaks the five eggs into a glass and downs and then goes and does his workout?

And then he wipes his mouth like that.

And it doesn't work if you don't wipe your mouth like that.

Just 5 raw eggs and you'll have the energy back.

Well, you can also eat little amounts of meat if you get tired often.

You know, little golf ball sizes of meats, and that'll pick you up.

But after a heavy workout, five eggs for your size of person, five eggs minimum.

[Attendee]   With honey or with milk.

[Aajonus]   No, you need the eggs alone?

And then maybe 20 minutes later, have some honey and butter.

[Attendee #2]   How do you combine the honey and butter.

[Aajonus]   Just stir it?

[Attendee]   And how much honey and butter.

[Aajonus]   For a workout like that for you, probably six butter to one?

Honey.

What about for when I do a yoga workout.

[Attendee #2]   Probably a little bit more honey in that situation, you're not burning as much fat?

Heavy workout like his, you're burning a lot of fat.

Burning is the wrong word.

We don't really burn.

We utilize the fat.

When you eat, you don't burn your nutrients up.

You don't cook them in your body.

You disassemble everything and they create different energy sources.

That's what happens.

So, it's not really burning a fat, it's utilizing fat as energy.

.

(28) Eggs Whits For Vision
[2007],[Attendee]

You were talking earlier about putting coconut thing in your eye for a particular condition, which I don't have, but my eyes are deteriorating

My eyesight isn't as good.

[Aajonus]   Egg white.

If you're getting scar tissue or you're getting layers on your cornea, then the coconut cream and the lime will work.

But if you just need protein to strengthen the cornea, so it doesn't misshape, you just put egg white in the eye.

People who put egg white in their eye, two to three times a day, usually lose 10 to 30% of their prescription per year, reduces.

But they do it two to three times a day.

The people who do it once a day, it may take two, three years for 'em to decrease 10%.

[Attendee]   One eye sees further and the other, you know, all that stuff.

I have no idea about the shape or what's causing it.

[Aajonus]   That's what causes it.

One, the conation gives you farsighted vision and the one that flattens gives you nearsighted vision.

[Attendee]   Are you saying you can use egg white for any eye problems.

[Aajonus],[Attendee]   Any eye problems

How much?

[Aajonus]   What I tell people to do is take the egg white and put a little dab on the little finger or this finger, usually the little one?

And you just get a little bubble of egg white on there.

You pull the lid down; you look up and you just rub it along the bottom of the white of the eye.

And then you open both of them and then you roll your eye like a circus master and get it all over coated, and then you close your eye and that's it.

You may be a little foggy for about two or three minutes.

It looks like you're going through some foggy water there a little bit, clears pretty quickly.

.

(29) Exercsiing & Stretching. Lymph Baths
[2007],[Fred]

When I last was exercising, I did like yoga stretches and weight lifting

If I stopped exercising, I found that after three months I was still the same strength, but if I stopped stretching for a week, I'd almost lose everything.

Why is there such a discrepancy.

[Aajonus]

On this diet, when you're eating raw meats and raw fats, I don't do anything?

I mean, literally I'm on the computer and I just hold this.

Once every February I'll come and trim some trees, about two tons of trees and drag those around and haul it, but that's the only heavy work I ever do, and I retain the muscles.

On this diet you retain muscle very easily.

However, because we're so toxic, we always have minerals combining with poisons to try to neutralize them, to alkalanalize those over acidic free radicals that are throughout the body.

So, that causes calcifications.

They call it calcification because the highest mineral is always calcium, but it's a conglomerate of minerals.

It's not just mainly calcium, but these deposits will collect everywhere and that causes stiffness, and then you have to get the lubrication.

You have to get the lymph system moving into those areas and the blood and the neurological fluids all have to get in there to make sure that these are dissolved and they don't stay growing as crystals.

[Fred]

Anything you can do to mitigate it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Be on the diet 40 years.

.

(30) Feeding Chicken Protein
[2007],[Attendee]

What about when they clip the beaks

Does that matter at all to you when they're chicken?

[Aajonus]   Most of 'em are gonna do that in those big ranches anyway?

Because they don't feed 'em good protein now.

Amos Miller's ranch and all my Amish farmer's ranch.

When I was in DC, I spent the at Amos's ranch, these chickens, they slaughter an animal and they take all of the remains out there, not the guts, they give that to the pigs and chickens, they'll take guts out there for the chickens.

And they slop it out there for those chickens, those chickens never peck each other.

Because they get all the meat that they want.

They're happy.

They're like happy ducks.

They will follow you, they're happy, they're nice.

They're not frantic protein deficient, crazy creatures.

[Attendee #2]   They feed them meat.

[Aajonus]   They feed em meat?

They feed them raw meat.

Meat scraps after butchering.

[Attendee #2]   They're so tiny though.

I mean when I buy the mat Rawsome, they're so tiny.

[Aajonus]   Well, just the one he slaughters.

He likes his older ones for laying eggs.

[Attendee #2]   There's no meat on it.

[Aajonus]   Well, there's little meat.

Very little.

.

(31) Fermented Coconut Oil
[2007],[Attendee]

Coconut cream

Would you leave that in the fridge for six months.

[Aajonus]

No?

It only takes 19 hours of room temperature for oil to separate from coconut.

It's that quick, 19 hours.

[Attendee]

From coconut cream.

[Aajonus]

From coconut cream, yeah?

And that's the process in the Philippines and Thailand where we get ours.

We're just getting Thailand right now from some friends of mine that make it.

And it's a 19 hour process and I've sat there and watched them do it.

And it's a delicate process and you have to have certain kinds- you've got these glass bats that are made and they go up and funnel like this.

And then they've got a glass decanter on it that allows- cause the oil goes to the bottom.

So, they have to drain the oil off of the bottom and then they have to do it again to make sure it's completely pure, so it doesn't start fermenting in any way, more fermentation cuz then if it goes into the jar and ferments, it's illegal in this country.

FDA says there can be no gaseous fermentation growing in a product, so they usually cook the hell out of everything, so nothing's alive and nothing's growing.

[Fred]

But you can make that yourself in the fridge.

Just put it in the fridge?

[Aajonus]

No.

Is it coconut oil.

[Fred]

Yeah?

[Aajonus],[They mean coconut cream, not coconut oil]

Coconut oil you don't put in the fridge.

It'll never separate.

[Fred]

Oh, just leave it out.

[Aajonus]

To get coconut oil out of coconut cream, it has to be room temperature.

Coconut cream in the refrigerator never separates or rarely separates and when it does it gets very slimy.

[Attendee]

Is it okay to eat both the oil and the cream.

[Aajonus]

Oil again just has the oil soluble vitamins?

And most of these vitamins are in the other part, the water soluble vitamins and enzymes.

That's why I like coconut cream.

I don't like coconut oil, unless it's for a medicinal process.

You eat the whole coconut cream.

[Attendee]

All of it.

[Aajonus]

That's what I'm saying, yeah?

You're eating the coconut cream.

That's what I do.

I don't have coconut oil, unless there's a problem.

If people want to detox some old oils in their body and old toxins, then eat coconut oil.

Maybe a tablespoon a day, or a tablespoon of olive oil a day or flax oil, but only as medicine.

.

(32) Fermented Soy
[2007],[Attendee]

Fermented whole soybean

[Aajonus]   Very bad?

The soybean is meant for herbivore.

In order for human to digest them, they have to be incredibly processed, there's a poison in them.

If they're germinated, they still are poisonous.

When they are fermented, there is less poison in it, but you still got a high IgG problem with it, and it's still a vegetable.

It takes an herbivore and to digest it.

An herbivore has two and a half times longer digestive tract than we do and has 60,000 times more enzymes to digest the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the protein.

We may get some starch from that bean, but it's not a good quality for the human body.

Let me say one more thing about that.

When you eat those fermented beans, they destroy some of the bacteria in the intestines and it can start forming a lot of gas, cause a lot of gas formation, and it can also cause the blood to get too acidic.

Cause irritability, cause weight loss, things like that.

Soy sauce is terrible in that way, causes a lot of weight loss or headaches causes, water retention.

It causes weight loss and muscle loss, muscle mass loss, but water retention.

.

(33) Fibermyalgia, Eggs and Milk
[2007],[Attendee]

Fibromyalgia

What?

[Aajonus]

I don't like her at all?

I won't date her.

Fibromyalgia is when you have aching everywhere in the body.

That's because toxins are storing in the nerves, in the muscles, in the tendons, everywhere.

To relieve that the best thing to do is just suck eggs and have a little bits of milk at a time, like a half a cup.

So, have a egg one hour the next hour, have a half a cup of milk, skip two hours, an egg next hour, half a cup of milk.

And just keep doing that for a couple of weeks to help relive it.

You could also have a little honey in that milk.

If you're eating kefir, it's even better.

[Attendee]

I find that milk really adds on weight though.

That weight just flies on with the milk.

[Aajonus]

You're drinking too much and you're drinking cold still or not.

I rest my case?

You're hesitating.

I know you're drinking it cold.

[Attendee]

During the day cold, but at night it's warm.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter.

You're putting on the weight when it's cold.

[Attendee]

Oh, is that right.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Just remember when the milk is cold, goes into the stomach, contracts the stomach, hydrochloric acid does not secrete, does not digest the milk, the lactate or the casein and a lot of the other proteins, and it does not divide and separate the minerals properly.

So, that clumps, gets into the blood.

You can't digest it properly, causes allergic reaction.

The body will store it in the tissues, something toxic.

[Attendee]

⁠How come you never told me that.

[Aajonus]

I did! Dozens of times?

[Attendee]

Cold kefir is okay right.

[Aajonus]

Cold kefir is okay, it's predigested?

[Attendee]

What about water.

[Aajonus]

Any kind of water is bad?

[Attendee]

But if you're gonna drink the water, you drink it cold.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter?

[Attendee]

How do you make kefir.

[Aajonus]

Two tablespoons of honey per quart of milk?

You blend that into some of the milk, you pour that back into the quart jar.

Then you put it in a cupboard, dark cupboard, and let it sit until it gets thick and you might shake it a couple of times, cause the cream will settle on the top and you want it to all digest together.

So, you may have to shake it a couple of times.

.

(34) Flowtron Is Bad, Copper Too High
[2007],[Attendee]

You won't taste

You can actually drink the water it's that safe.

You keep the copper below.

It's called Flowtron.

I think it's made in Arizona.

[Aajonus]

I've tested it, it's not good.

[Attendee]

We've had it for 20 years.

It's great.

[Aajonus]

There is a process where they use just a small bulb.

[Attendee]

It's a thing like this, it's solar powered and then it has a copper coil and it releases the copper and a copper is a wonderful with algae.

What you do is you monitor with a little tester kit you get, and then when it gets strong, above a certain point, you just take that out of the water for a week or two before you're ready to put it back again.

And the water's safe enough that you can drink.

If there were emergency and we all had no water suddenly where Laguna beach was cut off from a water supply, I could drink my pool water.

[Aajonus]

That's her opinion.

I don't agree.

I found the coppers too high.

Copper patinas, it rusts in the system, even in small amounts.

So, I don't agree with that one.

[Attendee #2]

Can you kill a plant by putting too much copper in it.

[Attendee]

Yeah, you can?

Absolutely.

But if you put enough.

If you cleaned out your coil and you dumped it on the plant, that would be very toxic.

You have to dispose it.

The coil has a protective thing around, but the water really has no taste, it's wonderful.

Now, I don't say the salt pools aren't as good, but this is very easy, and we've used it.

[Kathy]

Salt pools are good to have.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends.

.

(35) Foggy Mind, and Energy Drop, Carbs
(36) Foot Corn - Lime Juice
[2007],[Aajonus]

What she did

She went to a pedicurist to have the pedicure done, and she had a corn to have that worked on, scraped away as much as possible.

They told her it was a deep root.

I told her to take lime juice and use nothing but water and lime and if you want to use something on your cuticles, you take coconut oil for them put on the cuticles, but no soap in the water.

She let them put soap in the water.

Your lime juice is an antiseptic.

They love to use alcohol while they're cutting and trimming.

Lime juice is your antiseptic.

You just explain all that before you get started.

They're not comfortable with it.

Go to somebody else?

.

(37) Growth On Eye. Lime Juice and Coco Crema
[2007],[Attendee]

Do you know about this condition of this little growth in the eye

[Aajonus]

What about them?

[Attendee]

I would like to know how to eradicate it?

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends on is it a stye or is it a wart.

[Attendee #2]

It's a growth over the iris?

[Aajonus]

Oh, I see.

It grows over the cornea.

You can put some coconut cream in it.

You have to get it very warm, so it's diluted and there are no flakes in it.

There's no pulp in it, and you can put that with just a tiny speck of lime juice in it.

The lime and the coconut cream together you can put in there.

You put it right into the eye.

You can make a mixture of it.

Let's say you have two tablespoons of coconut cream and a drop of lime.

That's all it takes.

Mix that in, take your finger, make sure it's completely dissolved and clear, and then just rub it on the eye and then roll the eye around or you can rub it right onto that spot.

And you do that once a day.

It usually resolves it within about a year.

They're not easy to get rid of, that's heavy scar tissue.

.

(38) Hearing Loss, Hot Water Bottles
[2007],[Attendee]

Hearing loss

[Aajonus]

Pardon.

[Attendee]

Hearing loss?

[Attendees],[Attendee]

Laughs

Hearing loss.

My father got mad at me.

I was autistic, so I didn't know what the hell anything was being said anyway.

And he says, I told you to listen to me, he popped both of my eardrums.

So, I lost 60% hearing in one and 40% in the other and now I've got 80% in one and 80% in the other.

So, it does regenerate, but I've never found anything that regenerated it fast, unless you use a hot water bottle near your ear.

Cuz the passages into that network are very finite, so there's not much circulation in there.

The only way you can force more nutrients to heal the eardrum in that area is to put a hot water bottle near that area, and then put a towel over your head and over that ear to generate heat for several hours a night into that area.

And that will speed as long as you're on a good diet, that will speed it.

.

(39) Hemeroids
[2007],[Attendee]

I was just wondering what you suggest for treating hemorrhoids

I was reading in your book about alkalizing food, but is there anything specific?

[Aajonus]   Yeah, like I say in the book, take just a thin piece of meat and put it up there?

You might coat it with a little bit of honey before you put it up there.

Sometimes it doesn't stay up in there, slides in and out.

So, you might wanna make a little, carve a little barbell, a tiny one.

So it's got a plug at both ends.

So, it won't go in and it won't go out.

For one 1/10 people, that's a problem.

You know, my rectum was always so dry I didn't have to worry about that, but some people have very lubricated rectums.

Most people don't.

So, that's the best thing you can do.

Also, cabbage juice is good for that.

[Attendee #2]   My brother just finished the chemo two weeks ago, and he's had some symptoms of mucositis, it's excruciating pain.

Is there anything that you recommend that he could do.

[Aajonus]   Well, the chemo's coming out the mucus membranes, so he needs to eat a lot of milkshakes to produce a lot of mucus could get that out of his system?

Cuz as long as that chemical is staying in his mucus membranes, there's going to be pain, severe pain.

[Attendee #2]   So, can he have raw milk.

[unclear] , he's just scared to have anything like raw milk?

[Aajonus]   That's what he has to have, but with eggs, not raw milk alone.

It'll dry him out.

It won't help.

He needs to have eggs.

He needs to have ice cream is what he needs to have, raw ice cream formula, not frozen.

So half and half, milk and cream, honey and eggs, So, it should be one third cream, one third milk, one third eggs.

So, half a cup of each and about a tablespoon, two tablespoons of the honey.

[Attendee #3]   I have a sugar addiction.

[Aajonus]   You have a what?

[Attendee #3]   I have a sugar addiction?

[Aajonus]   Welcome to the club.

[Attendees]   Laughs  .

(40) High Liver
[2007],[Aajonus]

Well, liver's more concentrated in protein

That can cause some heavy detoxifications of the pancreas, the liver, and the brain.

When you have that concentration of high meat of, of protein, usually it's a better balance if you're using fat with the protein.

So, it's a little bit more balanced and regulated, but when you've got a concentrated protein like liver, you're asking for, and you're eating a lot of it you're asking for detoxification.

[Attendee]

So, we shouldn't eat that stuff in the old jars, straight out of the jar.

We should give it some time?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, give it a few cycles of opening it with the air getting into it again?

.

(41) High Meat
[2007],[Aajonus]

Now the high meat, the reason it works for depression and terrible moods is because the E coli, the last stage of digestion in your body, that E coli breaks down and has the final digestion of fats and proteins

It puts it in very micro, finite solutions that feed the brain and nervous system.

When you have poor E coli, you'll have depression all the time.

People who colonics and enemas, when they do the colonic and enema, they rush over 2 billion E coli into their blood streams, but then they're washing the E coli from their intestines out.

So, then they have to keep doing the Enemas or colonics to be able to rush the E coli into the system to be able to feed the brain and the nervous system, and it is a trap.

So, if you eat high meat, the bacteria in the meat predigest those in the same way the e-coli into finite molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system.

That's why when you eat high meat, does everybody know what high meat is.

Good?

Okay.

[Attendee]

I don't.

[Aajonus]

Oh, you don't.

High meat is when you take meat, you chop it up to small pieces, you put it in a jar and you let it start rotting.

Decaying.

The bacteria in the meat will start decaying itself, digesting itself.

And when that happens, then it will cause- if you're psychotic, neurotic, doesn't no matter what it is, depressed.

It will resolve that in 10 to 20 minutes after eating the high meat, it happens in so far 196 cases out of 200, even from the first time of using it.

So, it's a very good thing to use if you're depressed.

[Attendee #2]

Could you get a psychiatrist to prescribe that.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

You can get a few.

A few heard my lecture and tried it with some of their patients, and it worked every time they tried it, so they do recommend it.

[Attendee #2]

How long does it have to be.

[Aajonus]

If you make it out of the refrigerator, I usually tell people, so it doesn't stink up their houses and so they don't have to be as diligent?

They put in the refrigerator, they take it out every three to four days outside, open it up, put new air in it, screw it back on and put it back in your refrigerator, and that'll take about 14 to 21 days to be ready.

If you want it ready quickly, don't put it in the refrigerator, put it in a dark cupboard, take it out every two days and then put new air in it, and put it back in the cupboard.

If you go three, four days, it's gonna start gassing and stinking up your cupboard, and that hangs around.

That's why I say don't open it in your house.

Don't open it and eat it in your house cuz it will hang in the drapes, the rugs and everything.

People are gonna come in your house and say, what's dead in here.

It's dying?

What's rotting in her.

Are you dying?

Do you have cancer?

[Attendee]

So, how long does it take when it's in the cupboard?

[Aajonus]

It takes about 10 days?

10 to, to 12 days.

[Attendee #2]

Is it dangerous to eat too much of it.

[Aajonus]

I have a fellow who was about six foot tall, about 240 pounds?

Started on the diet, in about a year and a half, he was always impressed.

He became a landscape artist because he hated people, most antisocial besides me when I was younger and so ill, he was the most antisocial person that I ever knew.

Finally, after a year and a half, I got him to try the high meat and it worked for him in 10 minutes.

So, over the next six months, he adapted to eat only high meat.

So, he eats two pounds of high meat a day.

And the last time I went and did a workshop in his area.

He had three girls.

Now he's only about a 4.

8 or a 5 in the looks department, and he's still a big bear of a guy, but he became such a happy person.

He got a great personality.

Funny as can be.

I mean, he could be a standup comedian, be better than the top out there.

And he had three number 10 girlfriends at the same workshop together.

That's charm.

So, that's the extreme.

So, he only eats high meat, two pounds a day.

He doesn't eat any fresh meat.

[Attendee #2]

Does he have bad breath.

[Aajonus]

No, he doesn't?

I think your body adapts to it.

[Attendee #2]

But his house smells Laughs.

[Aajonus]

No, he has a shed that he does it all.

Separate refrigerator, separate shed.

[Attendee]

Is that mainly with just red meat.

[Aajonus]

No, it all depends on what kind of meat you need?

I do mainly fish, that causes my breath to stink, but I just deal with it.

I need to the fish because all the chemotherapy.

[Attendee]

With a lot of high meat with people that don't have any condition, like the person mentioned, can that cause detoxication symptoms.

[Aajonus]

I can't say that it does because in only about 5% of the cases do people go into diarrhea and vomit after having the high meat and that's a lower incidence of vomit and high diarrhea on a normal basis?

.

(42) Homogonization
[2007],[Aajonus]

A lot of people want to know what homogenization is

Homogenization is when they take the milk and they press it through a very, very fine sieve with high pressure.

So, it splits the fat molecule and when the fat molecule splits, it absorbs all the solids in the milk, so then it never separates.

The cream never separates.

That's homogenization.

However, when the fat molecule absorbs all of those solids they're Indigestible.

So, you're going to be drinking milk all the day long, pasteurized milk, never gonna be satisfied.

That's the way with any processed food.

There's no nutrient value.

So, you're always going to be hungry.

It's all criminal.

Any way they make food it's criminal because there's no nutrient value, no true nutrient value in it.

.

(43) Honey Doesnt Act As Antibacterial In Milk
[2007],[Aajonus]

No, it doesn't

It doesn't act as an antibacterial in milk.

[unclear] .

[unclear] and mainly the bulgaricus would be more active, that's to break down the fats and the proteins.

So, that's why it becomes bitter or tart even.

When you put the honey in it, it encourages the acidophilus to grow.

[unclear] and bulgaricus, but it doesn't destroy it completely.

I'll just reblend it and then drink it that way, unless it's too acidic.

If it starts causing my mouth to get a little stingy and burn or my tongue to get sore, then I'll just separate it and make cheese with it.

.

(44) Honey Okay On Weihgt Loss, May Cause Protein Deficiency
[2007],[Aajonus]

If it is, then you have some honey, honey's okay

[Attendee]

When you're trying to lose weight.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

Honey, as long as it's not heated over 93 degrees is mainly enzyme.

When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it predigests it, and adds an insulin like substance that converts the honey into mainly enzymes for digesting, mainly proteins, secondarily fat.

So, it will help you break down your fat in your body, honey.

[Attendee]

So, how much should you be using.

[Aajonus]

Well, not too much because it can cause a protein deficiency at the same time?

So, you need, let's say a half a cup of day.

No more than half a cup a day.

[Attendee]

What vegetables juice do you recommend.

[Aajonus]

Do something light that doesn't cause detoxification?

.

(45) Honey, Sugaraaddiciton, Weight Loss
[2007],[Attendee]

Cause I had some raw honey today and it made me want more

[Aajonus]

Go ahead, pig out on honey, it's okay.

I've eaten up to a quart of honey a day, but you can't do that every day, but pig out on it for a while.

[Attendee]

That's what made me, I ate a lot of bad carbs and whatnot and I gained body fat, which I didn't want to do, and now that weight planning we're talking about when you're losing all that weight.

Are you losing muscle weight, are you losing water weight.

How are you getting rid of all that weight?

What is it exactly that's being lost?

[Aajonus]

From eating the honey?

[Attendee]

From eating those eggs?

The weight plan suggested.

[Aajonus]

Well, you're losing mainly fat, but everything that goes along with it, everything that that fat is contained, all the poisons in that fat will be leaving your body too.

[Attendee]

That was like a good two years worth of bad sugars that I was.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, well, you've got a lot in there to remove and you may get lots of acne from it.

You may get some rashes, you may get some hives, just follow the things that it says in the book for that, because mainly fungus will break that down in your body.

Bacteria don't feed well on high carbs, high sugars, nor do parasites, except for the tapeworm.

It's hard to get a tapeworm in this country.

Everything's so poisoned in our system.

Tapeworms are very sensitive.

You kill those so easily.

You can eat a half of an onion and kill a tapeworm.

So, eat as much honey as you like, but if you wanna slow some of that down so that you're not just taking honey, have honey and butter mixture.

You can get it at Whole Foods, Rawsome.

You get a better quality at Rawsome Do you know what Rawsome is.

[Attendee]

No?

I'll look it up online.

[Aajonus]

No, you won't find it anywhere.

665 Rose Avenue.

Wednesdays and Saturdays.

[Attendee #2]

Can you eat honey and butter for nerve pain.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee #2]

How long.

[Aajonus]

Few minutes?

[Attendee #2]

I mean, for weeks or.

[Aajonus]

Oh, to have honey and butter?

Until it stops, until the pain stops?

With that condition already that old, a year and a half, but still, that's better than never going away.

Most of people have it for life cuz the doctors don't wanna repair it.

Pharmaceutical houses don't want it repaired.

[Attendee #2]

How often do you do the honey and butter.

[Aajonus]

Often as you have pain, as often as you feel when you need relief from pain?

.

(46) Hot Rubs and EMFs
[2007],[Attendee]

You advised me instead of doing the sauna to get a hot tub

So, I've done some research and found one that wasn't too expensive, but now you just blew my period.

[Aajonus]

It's got ozone.

[Attendee]

Yes.

Most of them come with the ozone.

[Aajonus]

But you can have them don't put the ozone.

[Attendee]

It holds 120 gallons of water.

So, tell me how to treat that, so we can take a bath.

[Aajonus]

You've got a problem with that unit.

You've got the motor under the unit, in the unit.

You've gotta have that motor three feet away from you.

It generates EMFs.

If you're gonna be sitting in it, and you have that generator on heating the whole time and your jets going the whole time, that EMFs gonna hit you.

[Attendee]

Is that guy willing to work with us.

He emailed you?

[Aajonus]

Well, he just emailed me the information, all the stuff that you just told me, but I haven't asked him what he will do to change it.

But see, he sells the whole unit.

The whole unit's intact.

It's made the way it is, not gonna work.

[Attendee]

What am I to get then.

I mean, the other spas are the same damn thing?

The motor is on the bottom.

[Aajonus]

You just have to get a separate pool guy to make a separate compartment and put extra hoses.

So, it won't be all contained in one.

Take the whole motor unit out, anything that generates an electrical charge.

[Attendee]

Do you know anybody that has one that can do this that we can work with them.

[Aajonus]

I had someone build mine?

I told them how I wanted it built, and they built it.

[Attendee #2]

How far away.

[Aajonus]

Well, I've got mine 10 feet?

[Attendee #2]

Yeah, but this EMF from a two horse motor.

Come on?

[Aajonus]

It's only three feet.

[Attendee]

Have it three feet away.

[Aajonus]

You gotta be three feet away?

[Attendee]

Okay.

That's one issue.

Now.

I mean, I didn't even think of that issue, but okay.

You were talking about that they have an ozone generator in the unit.

Now you're saying that's no good.

So, how am I gonna clean the water to go in it every night, instead of using my bathtub.

Cause I wanna get well, but I need to have that temperature hot, so I don't have to do the bath all the time is what you told me?

So I can do it six, seven days a week.

I mean, I'm trying to make this easy for myself.

[Aajonus]

It's not gonna be easy.

[Attendee]

Well, I'm trying to at least have it there and available.

I mean, you told me to get the hot tub, so I'm trying.

[Aajonus]

I said, you can get a hot tub, but you're going to have to rearrange it, depending upon the hot tub.

[Attendee]

Alright.

So, tell me how to do that.

[Aajonus]

I just told you.

[Attendee]

Okay.

You put the motor aside, but you didn't tell me how do I clean the water.

[Aajonus]

Well, ozone doesn't clean the water?

It just keeps the algae from growing.

[Attendee]

Tell me what we put in it so we can keep the water in there for four to six months and not have the pipes have some kind of film on it or whatever we have to worry about.

I don't know anything about this so.

[Aajonus]

You'd have to have an electrical chlorinator.

[Attendee]

So, you're saying that's the only thing that would work.

[Aajonus]

If you want it small and compact, that's the only way it's going to work?

[Attendee #2]

Does that create an EMF field.

[Aajonus]

Well, the electrical chlorinator isn't right there?

It goes through a system.

So, the water goes through that system where the charge is and sends the water back in.

[Attendee]

So that has to be separate also.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Anything that has the motor you're gonna have to.

[Attendee]

And how far away should it be.

[Aajonus]

Should be about three feet, at least three feet?

The only way you'll know for sure is IF you get a EMF field meter and you test it and see how far it goes to where it's zero.

[Attendee]

Okay.

And that electric coordinator is going to be sufficient not to use any other, I don't know, I've talked to pool guys and it's either, they say the ozone works 80% and then you have to shock the system with either hydrogen peroxide or some kind of nature 2 enzymes or non chlorinated.

[Aajonus]

This is getting way too complex, and this is too complex of an issue to take up here.

So, you'll have to call me for the rest of it.

[Attendee #3]

Can I ask you about a jacuzzi tub when it comes to that, you're not supposed to use a jacuzzi tub.

[Aajonus]

Jacuzzi tub's fine?

[Attendee #3]

Where's the motor on a jacuzzi tub.

[Aajonus]

Usually it's about a foot and a half, two feet away?

[Attendee #3]

And that's okay.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, what you could do is turn it on while you have a low amount of water in it and see where your EMF field is.

If it's at one corner, you just keep your feet away from that edge.

[Attendee]

Why not turn it off.

[Aajonus]

That's true, but some people like the jets, the air jets, but that would be the mistake to do, turn it off?

[Attendee]

Can I get a regular hot tub maybe and you just turn it off when you're in it.

Seems like the simplest solution?

[Aajonus]

But then when you have to heat it every few minutes to keep that temperature regulated, you're going to be in it.

If you get out it, then your body's gonna cool down, it won't work.

.

(47) Hot Sprigns Are Good
[2007],[Aajonus]

Wonderful

[Kathy]   Would that count as a lymphatic.

[Aajonus]   Well, you have to check the temperature?

It fluctuates because it's from the underground thermal pool and that even adjusts.

So, you just check the temperature.

[Kathy]   Would that count as a lymphatic bath.

[Aajonus]   What?

[Kathy]   At Glen Ivy?

[Aajonus]   If you stay in for an hour to an hour and a half.

[Attendee]   Do they let you put your coconut cream in it.

[Aajonus]   Laughs No at Glen Ivy?

They have several hot tubs there that have no toxic minerals.

Your skin's just gonna get dry, so take the coconut cream with you and put it on your skin several times throughout the day to oil the skin.

[Kathy]   So, then you have to dress up warm and walk.

Well, you're not gonna be walking for that?

[Aajonus]   Well, you can, you can leave?

You've got your pass.

You go take a walk around the area and come back in.

[Kathy]   You can dress up warm.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, you can do that?

Yeah, you can do that.

[Attendee]   I wanna tell anyone who's going there because most are too friendly to even ask, but when I go there it's too cool, which has happened twice recently.

You just ask the attendant to come and check the temperature of the pool.

I said it was 101°, and he, he said, "Oh no, it's not, it's 103°".

So, I said, "No, it's not".

He came and checked and it was 101°.

So, he can put it up.

So, they will do it cause I was very nice.

I was very sweet to them.

I said, you know, I've come all the way from San Diego and it's only 101°, and I have to have it for my healing.

He said, "Okay".

And then all the other people complained it's too hot.

Then they don't like it at 103°, but they will do it because they advertise it at 103° - 104°.

So, you just have to be nice to them and they'll come and do it at the beginning of the day.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, theirs is a controlled heat.

They have the thermal that comes out of the ground, but then they filter the water and then control the heat.

[Attendee]   They've got two heat sources, one cooler and one hot.

They both come from mineral.

Yeah.

[Attendee #2]   So, hot and cold are good for the body.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, just don't stay cold too long?

Stay in the cold maybe three minutes at a time.

.

(48) How Long After Startign Diet To Have High Meat
[2007],[Attendee]

Not really raw yet

How long would you say is like a minimum to wait to try this part.

[Aajonus]

About a month?

What she asked was I haven't been on the raw food diet.

How long would I have to wait before I can have the high meat, start taking high meat.

And I said about a month on the diet?

.

(49) How Much Coconut Cream Per Day
[2007],[Aajonus]

What I said was you have to use coconut cream to help dissolve those minerals and eating the lubrication formula will keep you lubricated

[Attendee]

What I'm asking is how much coconut cream would you recommend then.

Cuz I don't really eat very much of that for you?

[Aajonus]

For you I would recommend six ounces a day.

You're 6' 4''.

Yeah.

You could have more, you could probably have up to eight ounces a day.

.

(50) How Much Meat
[2007],[Attendee]

Were you eating meat

[Aajonus]

Oh yes, absolutely?

Gosh.

Yes, I have to cuz I wouldn't heal properly.

I wouldn't have enough protein.

So, I was eating somewhere around about a pound and a quarter to a pound and a half a day.

[Attendee]

Just beef.

What kind of meat?

[Aajonus]

No, I probably ate 50% chicken, about 20% fish and about 30% beef, buffalo?

[Jim]

I have a question about that.

How you keep yourself from going into shock.

How does anybody handle something like something like that, where you completely shook up and you kept your wits about you completely, but a normal person wouldn't?

[Aajonus]

Well, it's just that I made up my mind that unless I kept my witts, they were gonna do anything they wanted to me.

So, I just wouldn't allow myself to get into a state of lack of control, lack of awareness consciousness.

[Jim]

So, what's your normal person do if they get like bad news or a shock or something like that.

[Aajonus]

Breathe heavily?

And say, hey, it's part of life.

It is.

It's just part of life.

I wish that I'd had a camera to shoot all this cuz it was amazing.

I was shocked.

I mean really, all from this whole area like this, not only the skin was gone, the muscle and part of the bone was shaved.

For that to seal up in two weeks was amazing.

I mean, it was still very red and tender, but some of the bone had grown back.

Not all of it.

It's still partially gone, and all of the muscle in the skin had grown back, even though it wasn't mature flesh yet.

[Attendee]

Did you breathe heavy.

[Aajonus]

Oh gosh, yes?

Absolutely.

Deep, slow breaths.

.

(51) How Much Milk Per Day
[2007],[Lewis]

How much milk should I drink a day

Any barometer?

[Aajonus]

Well, that's up to you?

I drink two quarts a day in the summertime, maybe, a quart, a little over a quart in the winter, but I don't use heat, except when patients come.

My house is freezing cold, so I just bundle up cause I'm in the mountains in Malibu near the coastline.

So,.

it gets pretty cold up there, even hails and snows up there .

(52) How Much Milk Per Day2
[2007],[Attendee]

There's a notebook that I was reading

You talked about the guy who started Mayo clinic used to recommend anywhere from 2 to 10 quarts of raw milk a day for people.

Do you recommend a higher amount than you say 2 to 4 quarts.

[Aajonus]

You don't have that value of milk like he had in those days?

Cause he was doing that in the twenties and thirties and the value of milk was much, much better back then.

So, I think that I think that's too much.

I use two quarts a day, sometimes two and a half.

And during the winter I'll use less cuz I wanna stay warmer.

Stay warmer by keeping the H20 level down in the blood.

The thicker the blood is the warmer you stay.

So, I eat more cheese in the winter and less milk.

.

(53) How To Check Temperature
[2007],[Aajonus]

You can have a thermometer

[Kathy]

They're not very accurate, the one I've been looking at.

[Aajonus]

Well, get one that's for cooking.

What I use is a temperature one that you take the temperature on your tongue.

Those are usually pretty accurate.

[Attendee]

The swimming pool ones are not accurate, they're often 2° lower than what they should be.

So, you can't go by it.

[Aajonus]

No, you can't go by that.

[Attendee]

Are cooking thermometer that reliable.

[Aajonus]

Unless you used them for cooking, they will be reliable, unless you've used them for cooking?

Once they've gone through a high temperature change, they go off about 2° or 3°.

Even up to 6°, 7°.

Depends upon it.

.

(54) How To Increase Chi
[2007],[Attendee]

Certain forms of martial arts dealing with energy, they call it chi

Do you have any kind of diet or recommendation in terms of developing chi and unrestricting the flow of chi.

[Aajonus]

Well, that's just keeping it balanced as possible, and following the two diets that I've recommended in the recipe book?

One with two meat meals a day, one with three meat meals a day.

If you follow that, your chi will increase faster than anything else will do it.

I have quite a few martial artist masters on the diet, and let me tell you what they, where they went in two years it took them 20 years to achieve what they achieved in two years on the diet.

So, they had to work 20 years to get where they got in just two years on the diet.

Does that make sense.

They worked 20 years before they went on the diet to get to a certain place, and to get that much farther advanced, that only took them two years on the diet?

Also, a lot of the Scientologists who were going through different kinds of exercises.

I had one fellow that had tried to get into auditing for six years and his levels, they wouldn't even take him.

Three months on the diet he was an audit.

Just like that three months on the diet, his level evened out.

So, he was able to go into auditing.

[Kathy]

Auditing, you mean counting numbers.

[Aajonus]

No?

No, no.

if you don't know anything about Scientology, don't even think about it.

Counselling.

His metabolism was so off, so low.

.

(55) Injury
[2007],[Aajonus]

First of all, I'm gonna talk about, I had a nasty accident again in Thailand 13 weeks ago

Three and a half years ago, I had an accident in a car.

Somebody ran into the side of this SUV I was a passenger in and flipped it over a few times.

Broke my clavicle, two ribs, and collarbone, and I was back to making love with my girlfriend five days later.

So, accidents can't keep me down, broken bones.

However, this last one, I used to own three motorcycles when I was a kid, and when somebody ran me off the road in Los Angeles on one of the freeways, I decided to get rid of them.

When a truck purposely ran me off.

[unclear] to had take a week vacation, and I rented a big Harley while I was there.

I didn't have that Harley for two hours, two and a half hours, and I was going on a busy street only about 18 miles an hour, 20 miles an hour maximum, and there was no intersection, no driveway, no crosswalk and these five tourists jumped right out in the street in front of me.

So, it was either hit them and take a chance on killing two of them, cuz it was a pretty big bike.

It's about 350 pounds or so, and spending my life in jail in Thailand cuz when you hit somebody and kill somebody in Thailand, it doesn't matter who's at fault.

So, I decided bury it to the pavement.

So, I buried it on my leg, so when I hit the pavement, of course, the asphalt pulled my rump back this way and damaged my sciatica, and then the bike took my leg that way.

It popped it, I thought it was gone.

I thought my leg was off and separated at the knee.

It hurt so badly, and it took me a minute, and about 15 seconds to get the guts to look down to see if my leg was still there.

And it was still there, and the bike stopped about three feet from them and they just stood there and then they walked away.

They just stood there in the road and walked away.

And this one Thai lady, probably about 36, 37 years old, she saw it, she came and stayed with me and I stayed on the street for 20 minutes cuz the pain was so bad.

I wasn't gonna move, and everybody said to call the ambulance.

And I said, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm not going to any hospital.

At least not in that condition because it took all of the skin off of here all the way down, all the way back.

I was in shorts and t-shirt, so it took all of the skin all the way up here too.

So, there was no way I was going to go to a hospital and have them put iodine on it and give me an injection to settle me down cuz I was refusing everything.

So, it took me about 35 to 40 minutes to settle the pain down where I got on a taxi and there the taxis were just cutout pickup trucks with a frame on top and two metal benches on the side.

So, I took a taxi, I lied on the floor.

The Thai lady took care of arranging, getting a couple Thai motor bike driver taxis to take my motorcycle back to the hotel with me following the taxi, the other kind of taxi.

So, I got back to the hotel.

I had lime juice and I had coconut cream and honey there.

So, I cleaned all the wounds.

Of course, with the asphalt, there were chunks of asphalt all over, so black all over.

So, took the coconut, and lime juice and cleaned it.

Cuz lime juice, let me give you an example.

You see this little piece right here.

That's a piece of the asphalt coming.

That was three months ago, but when you put the lime juice on it, it surrounds it.

If you don't do that, then your body uses phenomenal amounts of white blood cells.

And then that's called an infection.

It will keep pussing and blistering, but the lime juice stops all that.

It will bring it to the skin eventually and just keep coming off in a slight scab.

[Attendee]

So, any kind of fall is required lime juice.

[Aajonus]

So you wanna do it with any kind of a wound, cut, anything like that?

Use lime juice?

Lemon juice is a bacterial, it incites bacterial activity.

That's why they use it for marinating.

It helps degeneration, it helps break down.

It helps predigestion of foods.

So, you don't wanna put that on your wounds cuz it'll just eat away your own body, lime juice seals it.

It seals the toxins.

[Attendee]

Does it hurt.

[Aajonus]

Oh, it stings like hell?

[Kathy]

You take a lime and just rub it.

[Aajonus]

I took the lime, squeezed it and rubbed it in and I mean vigorously and there was no skin and no muscle here?

It scaled some of the bone away.

This bone, you see this bone's a little larger than this one now.

And it took some of this bone away when I went down on the pavement.

Shaved some of the ankle bone off on the pavement.

So, the tendon that was over the ankle got scraped off, so it buckled up on both sides.

The two tendons here, you've got two rope tendons on either side of the knee.

This one ripped this way and this one ripped this way.

So, they were buckled up like this on the ends.

So, I got back to the hotel.

I washed everything out and put coconut cream in it, on everything, and then put honey on it.

And then the leg looked so bad and was in too much pain that I thought there was dislocated.

So, I said, well, call a taxi.

Let's go to the hospital, and I wanna have it reset.

So, they called the hospital and the ambulance came, four attendants take me the hospital, one driver and it cost me $12.

The price difference is astounding.

So, I got there and the intern freaked out when he saw my leg and my body, I wouldn't let them touch any of my wounds.

I said, I've already cleaned it.

They don't see any iodine on it or any methylate, so they think that I'm nuts.

And I told them I cleaned it with the with the lime juice and the coconut cream and honey.

And it was fine.

I didn't need anything else.

The intern was, you know, he is probably only about 27, 28 years old, and he wasn't gonna touch this leg.

And so he called an Osteo surgeon.

Osteo surgeon came, but he said, Osteo surgeon isn't gonna do anything without an x-ray.

I kind of figured that at that point.

So, I said, you get two x-rays, one shot this way, one shot that way and that's it.

You have to make your decision from those.

So, by the time the Osteo surgeon got there, I had the x-rays done.

I have them right here and you've got a big tibia bone right here, mines about as big as my fist, and it goes down all the way down to the ankle, and then you've got another bone that's smaller.

It goes on the back side, back inner side on both legs.

So, that tibia, the big bone, was split in two with about a quarter of an inch or more in the back open.

Plus the tibia goes up like this and the femur sits down in it like this, it broke the top off.

Other splintered pieces of fragments of that cartilage were in the knee joint.

So, the Osteo surgeon said, there's no way you're ever gonna walk again, unless we do surgery.

You've got bone fragments there, it's gonna stab the nerves in the knee joint, and you're just not gonna be able to put any weight on it.

He said, of course, I can't put a cast on it unless you let me operate.

I said, I don't wanna cast anyway, when I was nine years old, I had a ladder collapse and I shattered my heel cap and I had a cast for 12 weeks.

I was going nuts.

Cause you can't scratch it.

I mean, I would take hammers and hit it.

It was scratching itching so badly, and baths, no showers, anything like that.

So, everything was sponge bathing.

And that was no fun.

I love water.

So, I said, I don't want cast anyway.

And he goes, imitation.

And I said, I elect not to accept the surgery, but I'll be back in six weeks if I can't walk.

And he goes, imitation, thinks I'm out of my mind.

So, the hospital drove me back free of charge, back to the hotel.

So, I called my girlfriend who lived in the next town, and she knows my diet and everything.

So, I called her the next day.

I had enough food coming from Bangkok to make it through Saturday, probably part of Sunday.

So, she came on Saturday, brought, bought all the food that I needed.

The coconut cream is over there is easy.

They make it everywhere, everybody eats it.

So, she brought all the food that I needed, and then she stayed with me.

I had two, that one woman.

and my girlfriend stayed with me 24 hours a day for two weeks.

And I mean, I was in pain constantly.

Plus my girlfriend got a wheelchair, a wheelchair there, a good wheelchair cost $125, here it cost a thousand or more.

So, got me a wheelchair.

So, they were taking cold coconut cream.

We'd leave in the refrigerator and that's the only thing I would allow cold on the leg.

I have some hot water bottles.

And of course they went under, around the legs, different areas.

The places where I had no muscle, the skin as well as the muscle was gone here and here and in here, I put thin strips of meat to seal that over.

And I took gauze in all the areas where I put the honey and the coconut cream.

I only used the lime juice for two days.

Then after that no more lime juice, then after that was just coconut cream and honey, and then the gauze and the gauze, I would soak in coconut cream, then take the raw butter to put a thin layer on that, so the wounds would never dry.

And if they never dry you, they won't scar and then you'll replace the tissue very quickly.

So, in exactly two weeks, all of the skin had completely replaced itself.

Couldn't even see that any skin was gone from here.

I do have some scars still left here, little bubbles of scars here and here you can see there's a little bit of scar there.

Here there's a little bit, you can see it's still red here and down on the ankle.

You can see here part of this bone that was gone, all this was gone.

So, that's the only scarring left.

[Kathy]

Probably goes away after a while.

[Aajonus]

It will go.

That'll go away.

It will probably take about a year and it will be gone and you can see the knee is still larger than the other one.

And I can't straighten it all the way yet, but interesting thing that happened within a few days, all of the muscle in this thigh disappears.

So, I had this hanging flesh on this bone, this femur bone and all of that went to make a cast.

And the cast came from here down to the end of my toes.

And you could hit it.

It was like a hard cast inside under my skin.

So, the body formed its own cast.

However, when I tried to lift my leg, it still hurt very badly here.

The tendons grew back in one week, but the pain didn't.

In fact, I don't think that I had much pain from the broken bone.

What I had the pain was from those tendons that had ripped and those tendons, this one still aches a little bit.

Sometimes when I awaken in the morning, not when I walk, but when I waken in the morning.

So, the women were very nice, the one girl slept on the floor, they're pretty used to that there.

And then my girlfriend of course slept in bed with me, but they would, anytime I would moan, they'd be up and rubbing my leg, just very attentive.

Fabulous to have two people helping me, so nicely like that.

But the pain was so excruciating.

I spent a lot of the time in the bathtub.

Because when I hit the pavement and bruised my sciatica, my sciatica swelled about this big, cause I went down with a 350 pound bike and hit the pavement.

So, it was pretty bad.

So, I could only sleep like this with pillows under this, with hot water bottles on the side of it, towels draped over it.

So, this leg was up on towels and I had to sleep on this side.

Well, you can only sleep so long on one side of your body, so I'd have to get into the bathtub.

So, I'd have to use the crutches to get to the wheelchair, the wheelchair, to get to the bathroom, the crutches, to get from the door into the bathtub, and the ladies lifted my leg up into the bathtub as I sat on the edge of the bathtub.

So, that went on for about two weeks, and then I was okay.

I was able to get around on crutches.

Didn't have to use the wheelchair very much, but in that second week, I had some computer problems and I still have to work, so I will work a few hours at a time on my computer and I had some computer difficulties.

So I had to go to a computer store in that town wheeling me and these two Thai ladies are telling everybody because both of them had been in motorbike accidents and had huge scars from where they had been in accidents.

Mine much worse than theirs.

Mine was all sealed over already and you know, barely noticeable after a week.

And this one, it took two weeks and this, it took two weeks.

One on the ankle took two weeks.

So, they're going around telling everybody lime juice, coconut cream and honey.

They stop anybody because they couldn't believe that an old man, 60 years old could heal that quickly from that bad of an accident.

And they thought that I was crazy for not having the doctors take care of my leg too.

And then after two weeks I was getting around, so I let the one girl go and then my girlfriend stayed with me for another month.

So, I pretty much stayed in the hotel room up until the third week, and then the third week I decided the leg needed some exercise and I couldn't walk on it yet, still too much pain.

However, the pain wasn't excruciating, it was bad, but not excruciating after that point.

So I started going into the swimming pool at the hotel.

They agreed to lower the chlorine level and all of that, but after five days I started getting the swimmer's ear aches and the sore throat and the sinus problems and the headaches.

So, then I decided that I had to go across the road to the ocean or the bay, they have a gulf there where I was.

So, I had to walk on crutches down these stairs that were about probably a hundred stairs to get down to it.

So, I'd have my crutches going all the way down the stairs and then I'd have to walk on the crutches through the sand out to the ocean.

Then I had to put my crutches down and hop into the ocean far enough to get there, but it was a pretty shallow area.

So, I would get up to about this level and I would go a mile.

I would walk a mile, exercising the leg.

[Kathy]

Walk in the ocean.

[Aajonus]

Walk in the ocean?

Yeah.

So, they didn't have big waves cause it was a gulf and it was pretty quiet.

I mean if it storms you might have some big waves, or big boats come by.

So, I would exercise two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening to get the leg moving and make sure it was okay.

One time, something like a jellyfish, you step on those things and your foot goes down and down.

This one went in and they had to pull it back out and it popped the leg apart again.

So, that was hell.

That was after about four weeks.

So then I had another two days of excruciating pain there, and then I just made sure I touched ahead of that foot before I stepped that foot forward every other time I walked out there that only happened one time, but I did find a couple of those things that I would've stepped into had I not taken the time to check it.

And then after about six weeks, I threw the crutches away and started walking almost painlessly.

And then after six and a half weeks, I got on a plane and came back and, this is it, it's 13 weeks as of last night.

They said I'd never walk again without surgery.

What I did to help the bone dissolve those fragments.

I used three quarters of a cup of pineapple, half a cup of coconut cream and a half a cup of honey, blended those together and put it in a cup of milk and had that and had cheese.

I would have about eight weight ounces of cheese, which is a slice of cheese about like this, like you get in a package of cheese and I eat one of those a day and about, almost a liter of my pineapple, coconut cream and honey and milk mix.

So, the minerals in the cheese will help restore minerals in my body quickly to handle this.

I knew that all of that muscle had disappeared and I just had flesh over it because my body needed all the nutrients to make that cast on its own.

But within two weeks after the cast had been made, which was by the end of the first week, and then two weeks after that on the third week, the cast started disappearing from the foot and in this area and in this area, and in this area.

It's still here.

This is still pretty much hardened cast right here.

If you feel this, you can feel softness around.

If you feel this, you'll see, it's still hard like a cast around there.

The whole leg was like that.

So, this is the only area where it's still slightly cast, and I can still move it.

[Kathy]

It's amazing how the body helps you.

[Aajonus]

If you know what to eat, the body is extraordinary to know what to do.

So, the pineapple helps bone rebuild.

Also, the pineapple with the coconut cream helps dissolve bone tissue if your body needs to do it, it can use it for either way.

So, that's how I did it so quickly.

So, I did that every day for two weeks.

Then after that, I just mainly ate cheese and honey together and cheese with everything, but mainly cheese and honey to utilize the minerals.

So, that's an excellent supplement is cheese and honey together, but the cheese and the honey have to be in the mouth together to make it work.

If you have cheese by itself or another with honey in it, the honey is already absorbed by the other food and utilized with the other food and won't necessarily do much with the cheese.

So, the honey and the cheese have to be together in the mouth for you to digest it.

Otherwise, the cheese mainly acts as a sponge to attract heavy metals and other toxic substances out of the nerves, nervous system, the blood stream and the lymphatic system as they weed their way through the digestive tract.

(56) Kefir Grains Arent Natural
[2007],[Aajonus]

Kefir grains had been washed a dozen times

They are nothing natural anymore.

They're an entity amongst themselves and they will interfere with your own bacterial environment in your intestines.

So, if you use the bacteria in the milk to predigested itself, along with the honey.

It's the natural bacteria that's fresh from an animal and it's natural, and it will help your own bacterial environment.

The grains will interfere.

You'll it'll digest the milk for you, but it's not going to help you improve your digestion.

.

(57) Marinating Meat Orange,lime,lem,grapefruit
[2007],[Attendee]

I marinate my fish in lime juice

[Aajonus]

But I've told you many times, lime is an antibacterial.

So, don't do it's.

Lemon is the thing to marinate, once in a while you can do lime juice.

[Attendee]

Does lemon or lime juice ruin the teeth.

[Aajonus]

Well, neither will ruin the teeth, unless you're eating them too much and you don't have enough fat?

Okay.

Okay.

I have a beef.

Okay.

Something about that.

Yes.

I have found be order to ask you this, Do you have a question.

[Attendee#2]

Yes?

I have found that by adding half orange to half lemon, it doesn't whiten the meat with the chicken or fish, so I can leave it there longer and it doesn't go all that quite horrible as if it's been broken down.

[Aajonus]

That's fine.

I marinate sometimes in grapefruit juice.

[Attendee#2]

Yes.

It's much better.

[Aajonus]

Grapefruit juice in fish is phenomenal, and it isn't near as strong.

It isn't even a fifth as strong as lemon.

But some people don't like the taste of grapefruit.

[Attendee#2]

The orange and lemon is beautiful.

[Aajonus]

Japanese use oranges a lot for that.

.

(58) Meat Sauces. Lemon Demineralization
[2007],[Aajonus]

Have you tried the sauces

There are so many sauces in the recipe book?

Just a taste of it makes it easy to eat fish, even if it isn't marinated.

Marinating a little bit in lemon is fine.

I wouldn't do it in lime all the time.

Lime is antibacterial, lemon juice is fermentation.

Helps ferment and break down the fish.

And if you're going to do that, you just might rinse it off if you want get the excess lemon off.

Is it bothering your teeth or you notice a difference.

[Attendee]

Yeah?

[Aajonus]

Well, you're just so thin.

You have no extra fat.

[Attendee #2]

Why would it bother his teeth.

Why would it affect the lemon?

[Aajonus]

Well, the lemon has a tendency to attach itself to minerals, a lot of minerals, and also it searches for fat?

The more fat it pulls, the more minerals go with the fat.

The reverse of that is if you have too much cream, you can demineralize the system because the cream will start pulling minerals out of the body.

Butter doesn't do that for some reason.

Cream will, excessive cream.

[Attendee #2]

But the lemon and butter in the lube formula is fine though, in terms of pulling.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's fine?

Won't do it.

You can put too much lemon in, absolutely.

And you'll have the same thing happen, but you know, I have that limit in there, but what I put in the book is the absolute maximum, you can always reduce it.

You have a lemon problem.

So, my suggestion for you would be put on more weight, and try to use less lemon, try to use some of the other sauces.

Because there is a lot of good sauces in there that you could to eat the fish raw without marinating it in lemon.

.

(59) Melatonin, Supplements, Are All Toxic
[2007],[Aajonus]

Melatonin, all of them are chemicals

There is no such thing as a natural supplement.

It has to be heat or solvent extracted always, no other way about it.

If you want a substance like that, you've taken it into a rock form.

Feed it to your plant, take those supplements and feed it to a plant that you're going to eat from.

You're gonna juice the plant juice, juice the leaves, then you're gonna get a phenomenal amount that you'll be able to utilize, and won't cause a collection of toxicity in your body.

[Attendee]

Even like standard process.

Aajonus] Even standard process, it's all bullshit?

They say, "Well, we told the laboratory", but the laboratory's gonna make the products and it's gonna do things that it may not tell you exactly how it is, does it.

And they say, "Oh, well, it's our patented way of doing it".

But let me tell you, I've been in all those laboratories and every one of them uses chemical.

And usually benzene a derivative of benzene is universally used in all laboratories to extract nutrients.

And you have to understand if they want those finite nutrients and there are very little of them in a food.

Where are they gonna get it all.

They're gonna process all this food and have all this waste product, not going to happen?

Just like vitamin E, 99.

9% of vitamin E comes from Fuji and Kodak.

It's not even a vitamin E truly.

They paid their scientists millions of dollars to come up with a way to take care of their development fluid waste.

One scientist who was very, very bright realized it was 70% of the structure of vitamin E, D alpha-tocopherol, 70% like it.

Not like it, but 70%, like it in molecular structure.

So, he convinced everybody to sell it as vitamin E.

So, when you get a natural vitamin E supplement, let's say you've got a hundred units of vitamin E and that's in that capsule.

5% of it's going to be from soy or corn.

The other 95% is going to be from Kodak and Fuji, which is a toxic solvent.

It.

Saves them hundreds of million dollars a year in storing that chemical.

So, they just combine it with oil and call it vitamin D.

So, no supplements are safe and good.

They will poison you and give you highs.

They will contaminate you and cause adrenaline rush and make you feel like you're good, but so does cocaine.

That doesn't mean it's healthy.

You'll get rid of symptoms, but that doesn't mean you're getting better.

That doesn't mean you're getting well.

That doesn't mean you're getting rid of your disease.

Sometimes it will stop the disease because the body has to use all of its nutrients just to handle the poison.

If you want a short life, hell, it's the way to go for some people, and that's okay.

I have no judgment about it, but if you wanna have a chance on longevity without disease, it's not the way to go.

.

(60) Milk Diet
[2007],[Attendee]

What do you think of a milk diet, as opposed to

.

.

let's say an all milk diet where you have chronic disease: asthma, diabetes.

As opposed to something where you have milk and meat, would a milk diet be fine.

[Aajonus]

No, in some cases it will be, but it depends upon the individual and the type of problems in the body?

[Attendee #2]

You're talking about raw milk though.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Raw milk.

She's talking about an all raw milk diet.

She's asking, can a raw milk diet cure diseases.

Yes, it can cure some, definitely.

It's cured emphysema, tuberculosis, diabetes of all sorts.

So yes, it's possible.

[Attendee #2]

And that's just raw milk.

That's no vegetables.

[Aajonus]

No, that's nothing else, but just a raw milk diet?

[Attendee]

What if you used raw milk instead of as your meat.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't work?

If you're very skinny, you've been a vegetarian, a raw milk diet isn't gonna work for you.

[Attendee]

I don't mean an all raw milk diet, just a, a diet where instead of eating, let's say eggs or meat and stuff, you substitute, so all that type of stuff, like eggs and meat and all your animal products are milk or butter fat.

[Aajonus]

I just said, no, it doesn't work.

[Attendee]

Any reason.

What's the reason?

[Aajonus]

I don't know the reason?

Just doesn't.

.

(61) Milk Makes You Sleep
[2007],[Attendee]

Of course milk, you know, and I'm drinking the kefir before I go to sleep

It's also with honey and eggs.

[Aajonus]

Milk.

If you've had a lot of adrenaline overreaction in your lifetime and you start drinking milk, you're gonna react like a baby cause that whole nervous system needs to relax.

Eat, and sleep, eat, and sleep.

Honey does the same thing.

It is so healing so rapidly that the body just wants to use all of its energy to relax the nervous system.

So, that's why you go into sleepiness.

It's not a diabetic reaction.

Diabetic reaction is spacing out, getting dizzy, blacking out.

Getting very dizzy, you stand up and everything goes black and you're trying to hold onto nothing, so you don't pass out and break your head or nose or teeth.

That's a diabetic reaction.

.

(62) Miracle Mineral Supplemnt
[2007],[Barbara]

This is a stupid question in some ways, and yet it's going to be asked a lot

So, I wanted to ask it.

It's coming out on the internet now and it's been used in Africa.

There's a product called MMS.

Have you heard of it.

[Aajonus]

Mhm?

[Barbara]

Miracle mineral supplement and from reading about it, it is, they saying it's actually di-chloro chlorine oxide.

It's got two chlorine molecules for the oxygen and they've been curing hepatitis, aids, malaria and cancers, and many other things with it.

And really they've stopped them using it in Africa because the drug companies have said they will not give any more money in aid to Africa if they allow it to come into the country.

Now it's been coming into this country and it's coming from Canada and other places.

It seems a miracle.

But to me, having known what chlorine is like, but they do say that when the chlorine is released with the vinegar or the lemon juice or citrus acid, it actually had the waste product become sodium and chlorine.

So, just mixes with it.

So.

I'm not sure.

I'm wondering if you knew about it and whether you could help us because if this is such a miracle in those third world countries, does it mean that it's right for us or is it gonna kill all the organisms in our bodies as well as the bad ones.

[Aajonus]

Okay?

Go back to what I said in the rest of ebook, 72% of all diseases will reverse on their own, all conditions.

All these people take claims that their product cause these reversals when it's a natural process of the body healing itself.

Somebody gets a disease, they take that product, their body's in the process of healing itself anyway.

That product has nothing to do with them healing.

[Barbara]

Even with malaria that takes us two days, which would normally take weeks and weeks and months with hepatitis.

[Aajonus]

We don't see enough of those?

I've read the literature and not enough cases proves that to me.

A lot of people will heal in a few days with malaria people who live in the jungle heal very rapidly.

A whitey, one of us, white bred people go down there.

Not me.

I won't get it.

I don't even get malaria even if I drink water that's been hacked into by somebody with malaria cuz I've done it.

But the average person who's on the sad, the standard American diet goes down there and gets malaria.

Their malaria is going to do a lot of cleansing for a very long time.

So, they may keep malaria a couple of months, but your native isn't going to keep it long at all.

[Barbara]

Why have they died of it then.

[Aajonus]

They don't die of it?

They die of the treatment.

They die of the penicillin or the amoxicillin, or the Cipro that they're getting to handle it.

Whatever they're getting that is poisoning them.

.

(63) Modly Cheese
[2007],[Aajonus]

Moldy cheese

I scrape the outer white layer off cause that has all the spores in it and you can get too much mycelium generating in your system and you can get very lethargic.

.

(64) Mold Detox Drink
[2007],[Aajonus]

You need to have about, depending upon the size of your body, anywhere from 4 -5 tablespoons of lime juice

Like if you're a very large person, like John back there.

He could have 8 tablespoons of lime juice and there would be like 1.

5 - 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, then you'd have an equal amount of the lime and lemon combination.

You'd have an equal amount of honey to that combination of lemon/lime.

So, if you have six tablespoons of lemon/lime altogether, you'd have six tablespoons of honey.

Then you have 5 - 6 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 - 2 tablespoons of dairy cream.

You blend that all together.

Some people, if they have a lot of allergies, they need to use a half to a whole teaspoon of vinegar, and then you blend that all together and you add it to 2 - 4 ounces of sparkling water.

INGREDIENTS: (depending on size) 4-5 TBSP of Lime Juice 1.

5 - 3 TBSP of Lemon Juice 5.

5 - 8 TBSP of Honey 5 - 6 TBSP of Coconut Cream 1 - 2 TBSP of Dairy Cream

It's gonna taste like a lime coconut float.

Do not gulp it, even though it's delicious.

You've got to sip it cuz if you piss it out, it's not going to get in there and destroy the molds.

Now you only do that.

If you have a mold situation and you're very toxic, you can do it for three to four days in a row.

Then after that only one day a week, because just like an antibiotic that lime juice will will destroy the good bacteria, as well as the bad, once it gets up to a certain level.

Well, it's good as an antibiotic.

Let's say you have a case of spinal meningitis or cerebral meningitis, and it's too much.

You're gonna panic and end up going to the hospital, rather than go to the hospital, have that.

And that'll slow that detoxification down.

[Fred]

You said mold on cement's okay.

[Aajonus]

Mold on cement is okay?

I mean, once the lime has broken it down it still doesn't absorb and digest very easily into our systems on this diet.

I mean, for a person who isn't not on the diet, they may have a problem with the mold in concrete.

.

(65) Mold Toxicity
[2007],[Attendee]

Type of molds that are dangerous

What can harm you.

And then do you have any recipe for in case I was exposed to mold and to stop it from?

[Aajonus]

Any mold that grows on a building that is not wood, is not concrete, is a toxic mold cuz it's feeding on the building materials, the fabricated building materials, it's always a toxic substance?

It will always be a toxic mold, a toxic fungus, and when it spores, you breathe those in.

What you have to do to the environment, to your walls, wherever it's contaminated.

You need to dry out the room, wear a mask, vacuum the walls and the ceiling and the floors.

Then you have to wash it down with vinegar and some non-aluminum baking soda and a little bit of the Biokleen degreaser, cleaner degreaser.

And what that has in it, they use grapefruit seed oil and lemon peel oil in that particular soap detergent, and it's the only one that I know is 98% biodegradable, all the others say biodegradable, including seventh, whatever they call themselves seventh generation, and like 12% is biodegradable.

Everything else is toxic.

So, when they say you have something as biodegradable, it's usually a false statement.

Very little bit of that is biodegradable.

Anyway, wash the walls down thoroughly and you wear a mask this whole time, and then you have to dry out the walls.

You need some space heaters, coil based space heaters, those things get coil and orange hot.

Two or three of them per room.

If you're doing a room at a time and then you need to seal off one of the rooms with some kind of a canvas in between to keep the heat in there, cuz it needs to get up to about 130° and that'll bake it through into the wall.

You need to do that for about two days, bake it.

So, you destroy the mold deep into the wall, and then you need to vacuum it again, cuz it will spore as it's first getting warm.

The mycelium, which is the basic mother of the fungus is setting out little spores, and they create those little fuzzy things.

Those are your mushrooms, those are your spores.

So, you need to vacuum that then you're okay until you have another rain spell or moisture spell.

If you don't keep your house very dry.

If you're living in at a beach where it's always moist, you're in trouble.

You may have to do that every month, every two months.

[Attendee]

If your house is made of wood.

[Aajonus]

If your house is made of wood, no problem?

[Attendee]

What about the paint from the mold.

[Aajonus]

The paint?

That's a problem.

That mold is not a problem with an animal's body, including ours.

But if the paint's getting moldy, you've got trouble, plaster board, any of it that.

Cause what it does is mycelium digests the paint, makes it into flakes.

The mycelium that's grown on paint is very toxic substance, when it spores and that becomes powder in the air and we inhale it, it poisons your lungs.

It poisons your whole body.

.

(66) Nerve Damage, How Much Cocontu Cream. Molds
[2007],[Attendee]

I need to eat cucumbers and the coconut cream, but how much of the coconut cream per day

[Aajonus]

Well, coconut cream is very detoxifying?

So, I usually say no more than five ounces a day for somebody your size.

[Attendee]

Does that regenerate the nerves.

[Aajonus]

That doesn't regenerate?

See, anytime you have shingles, it's from penicillin or antibiotics.

The molds grow perpetually in some people, in a lot of people.

It stores in the joints a lot.

Penicillin will usually come out as a black mold.

Can cause a black mold on the hands, you see it in people's nails or on their feet.

You see black areas in their feet.

It's all penicillin discharge and mold.

That's the excrement from the penicillin.

Tetracycline is a little different.

It sounds like you have Tetracycline or Cipro or something like that because your nerve damaged.

See in some people you can't stop it.

It grows and grows and multiplies like crazy.

[Attendee]

Coconut cream and cucumbers.

[Aajonus]

That doesn't regenerate the tissue, that helps clean that tissue out of there, but to destroy the molds?

[Attendee]

So, what about the pain.

[Aajonus]

The pain, you have to use the pain formula in the recipe book, honey and butter, eating a little bit of that all day long?

Soak it in hot water with coconut cream and milk in it.

Hot water bottles.

Put your hand on a hot water bottle at night.

All of that heat is to make sure that you increase circulation into that area.

Anytime you have a bruise or a sprain or a break, never put cold ice on it.

When you do that, you constrict the circulation into that area.

You're restricting the nutrient flow.

So what's gonna happen.

You're gonna keep the bruised tissue in the area and you're gonna scar?

What happens to those athletes that keep putting ice on it.

What happens?

They have surgeries, multiple surgeries because they never heal properly?

They keep re-injuring and re-injuring.

Remember Oscar that I talked about at We Want To Live.

The skier, put him on a good diet?

He won two medals a year and a half after his injury where they say he'd never even be able to dance again.

And you know, in Switzerland he won metals, so the body can heal itself if you don't freeze it up, if you don't constrict and you allow the proper nutrients.

Putting ice on an area any more than two minutes is a bad thing.

Put lots of heat on it, and then if you just want to numb the pain a little, put some ice on it for a little while.

Like I say, when I had my problem and the pain, my leg would just get burning hot and painful, so the Thai ladies would take the refrigerated coconut oil and coconut cream, which is hard as butter when it's cold.

So, they take a big glob of it, just rub it over my knee and down the shin and up and down for about five minutes, but not one place did it stay on, did the ice sit there.

And it was never that cold as ice.

It was down to about 50°, maybe 48° degrees, 45° degrees is all it was.

And that was enough to numb the pain, but not enough to cause a restriction of circulation of nutrients into the area, that you do not want to do.

Because you will scar and you will not heal properly.

So, lots of heat in hot water will help you perspire the toxins that remain that cause the nerve damage from the fungus waste.

[Attendee]

Lot of heat.

[Aajonus]

Lot of heat?

[Attendee]

Butter and honey.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

How to get rid of the mold, I wrote an article, it's in the newsletter this week.

So, just pick it up on the newsletter.

.

(67) Ocd, Raw Milk, Raw Cream. Soda Cravings
[2007],[Attendee]

She asked me what do you commend for any kind of obsessive compulsive for conditions

[Aajonus]

You're talking about excessive compulsive in physical activity or mental.

[Attendee]

Both?

[Aajonus]

Lots of milk and lots of raw cream.

Settle the body down.

[Attendee]

He drinks a lot of soda and she's just trying to find a way for him to stop.

[Aajonus]

Lots of milk.

You can make something like a mixture of take about.

.

.

1/2 cup of fruit 3 tablespoons of coconut cream 5 tablespoons of raw cream 1.

5 tablespoons of raw honey

Blend that all together, and put it with about three ounces of Gerolsteiner.

It'll make like a float, a fruit float, and that's very satisfying.

[Attendee]

Any idea how to stop the craving for soda.

[Aajonus]

That's what I'm talking about?

That will help stop the craving for the soda.

He'll start craving that instead of the sodas.

.

(68) Old Milk Always Better
[2007],[Attendee]

What are your observations on the difference between fresh milk and old milk

[Aajonus]

Just remember that old milk is always better because just like in the high meat and all of that, it's breaking down?

Doesn't taste as nice and as fresh and as delicious, unless you put honey in it as soon as you get it home.

My milk, most of the time, I put my honey in as soon as I get home.

Because I drink a half gallon or a little bit more than half gallon a day in the summertime when it's hot cuz I don't drink water and I'll take about 16 ounce glass canning jar.

I'll put about 12 ounces or 10 ounces of milk in it and about six ounces of honey in that.

And then I blend that, and then pour a little bit into all of my half gallons.

I'll have about six to eight half gallons of milk.

So, I put a little bit in each one, of course, I pour out a little of every one and then pour that into it.

And then it stays sweet even if it goes off and the bacteria is growing in it.

[Attendee]

Do you put it in the refrigerator.

[Aajonus]

Yes, I do put it in the refrigerator?

However, a day or two before I'm going to drink it.

I put it in a dark cupboard out of the refrigerator because I like to have kefir.

[Attendee #2]

I'm sorry.

You put it in the refrigerator right after you put the honey in it.

[Aajonus]

Let me start it over again?

I take the milk home, I take a little out of each container, I put it in a jar, I blend about two tablespoons of honey per quart of milk.

Two tablespoons of honey per quart.

So, that's four tablespoons of honey per half gallon.

So, I pour that much into each half gallon.

I put it in the refrigerator.

I put some in the cupboard immediately and I have some left from the day before, because I like my milk 24 hours or more old before I drink it.

In fact, I like it thick like kefir and sometimes that takes up to two days.

So, that's the way I will have it.

.

(69) Olive Oil Swishing
[2007],[Attendee]

Today I had read about an olive oil cleanse for the teeth, and I wonder if you know about that

You take a tablespoon of olive oil and you swish it around for three minutes and spit it out.

Do you know anything about that.

Or how do you feel about it?

[Aajonus]

It works?

I mean, any kind of fat, it isn't just olive oil.

It's any fat, you swish it around in your mouth, the gums.

Remember the gums are the major detoxifiers for the brain, the gum, the tongue and the salivary glands.

So, you've got that oil in there, it's all in the mechanism already.

When you have that fat swishing around, it's going to dump.

It's like when a baby suckles the teet or a nipple on a bottle, heavy toxins come from the brain into the mouth and go down there with the milk to detoxify it, but that's a tremendous mineral loss for the baby, but yet it's protecting the baby's brain.

.

(70) Overweight
[2007],[Attendee]

So, I had the consultation yesterday

You said my weight was perfect, but actually I'm probably 60 pounds heavier than I wanna be, and like I played basketball this morning.

Like a bull in a China shop.

I mean, I feel best probably about 190 pounds, and I'm 270 right now.

[Aajonus]

And how tall are you.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

I'm 6' 2''

5' 7'' & 3/4, and I'm 182 pounds and he wants to be 190?

Does that make sense.

No?

[Attendee]

When I was 18, that's when I was.

[Aajonus]

That was when you were 18.

[Attendee]

Well, anyway.

I wanna dump a lot of weight.

I mean, you know, exercise and stuff like that.

I wanna get back into playing shape.

[Aajonus]

Well, would you rather be happy or fit looking.

[Attendee]

Well, I was happy when I was down to 200, a couple years ago?

[Aajonus]

That's when you were a kid.

[Attendee]

No, no.

Two years ago I was down to 200.

I stopped playing for about a year cause I had business and stuff.

Yeah, I'm gonna be happy regardless, I'm not worried about that part.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah.

I saw your eyes, I don't think so?

[Attendee]

I can't be unhappy.

Is that going to harm me as long as I'm taking lots of raw fat and stuff, I just exercise.

[Aajonus]

If you ate every hour, no?

If you can eat every hour, if you can eat some fat every hour, you can stay at a lower weight.

As long as you don't get injured.

Yeah.

If you get injured, then you're in trouble.

Like when I got injured here, I was up to 192 pounds.

I'm 23% body fat.

Do I look it.

No?

Because fat molecules when they're not cooked are very small, very fine and very concentrated.

When you cook a fat, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size.

So, I've had nothing but raw fats since 1972.

So, the fats in my body are all small, so I can be fat, but not look it.

They say that an athlete, male athlete should be 7% to 10% body fat.

I'm 23% body fat, three times what I'm supposed to if you look at 7%.

[Attendee]

I think I'm about 45% right now.

[Aajonus]

You're probably 32%, 33%.

Anyway, you can take off some weight, but if you get uncomfortable and start having problems, put it back on, regain it.

.

(71) Ozone
[2007],[Aajonus]

Ridiculous

Ozone is very bad.

Ozone will oxidize the fat in your skin, then your skin will start dissolving.

So, not good for the skin.

[Attendee]

All these places advertise ozone.

[Aajonus]

They were sold a false bill of.

.

.

if you ozonate anything- one way you can really tell how bad it is is find somebody that will give you ozonated olive oil.

It is the foulest smelling shit in the world, and shit is a good thing.

But this oxidized olive oil is foul smelling, and it's very repulsive.

It putrifies it.

[Attendee]

There are people that are injecting ozone.

[Aajonus]

I know I've watched 12 of them die.

It's just people get hoodwinked into doing these things and you have to look who's behind it.

Who comes up with these ideas.

Ridiculous?

.

(72) Prediabetes
[2007],[Attendee]

I've done the diet a little over a year, and I go to the doctor for the regular tests and one of the blood tests, I've never had this problem before

I just had it redone after I saw you the last time.

So, I'm showing pre-diabetes with very high sugar, and I do notice that sometimes when I eat certain things, like I feel my heart rate going really fast.

And of course, I'm just eating the meat, the dairy and the honey and all that.

And I started cutting down on the honey, but I wondered if there's any other.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Is that all the symptom you're having.

[Attendee]

The palpitations and I don't know?

I didn't feel right before I did it, and I was wondering, because I didn't have sugar for like 20, 30 years before I went on your diet.

[Aajonus]

But that's not a diabetic reaction.

The diabetic reaction is spacing out.

Getting very weak, getting dizzy, blacking out.

I had diabetes.

I know what diabetic symptoms are.

[Attendee]

So what's that.

[Aajonus]

Heart palpitations, that can come from minerals, having metals getting into the blood at one time, the heart does not want to let it settle, so it pumps the blood fast through there hoping some minerals in the digestive tract will attract them out of it?

[Attendee]

So, what's the prediabetes test that he's saying I have.

[Aajonus]

The prediabetes will make almost 80% of the people who get their tests done look diabetic or prediabetic?

It's meant to do that, to get you thinking, "Oh, I'm going diabetic.

Maybe I should end up taking diabetic medicine, insulin".

[Attendee]

But I wanted to know, is there's anything I should or shouldn't do with the diet, you're saying, nevermind.

[Aajonus]

If you're having heart palpitations like that, you drink cream?

I have it if I have a juice in the morning, if I have more than eight ounces, My heart will go like this.

I'll get a little sugar reaction, but it's not a diabetic reaction.

It doesn't mean I'm not utilizing my sugars.

I'm utilizing too many sugars, which is the opposite diabetes.

Plus all the minerals that are pulled out, so I'll put it either an egg in my juice or a little cream in it the next day, but it only happens to me first thing in the morning.

One out of 15 days, but if I can tell it's going to happen, I'll put my egg in it and cream in it, and then I don't need to worry about it the next day.

Diabetes is reversed by having a proper fat.

[Attendee]

I'm not saying that she should eat no fat, but I'm saying her body weight in general.

[Aajonus]

Wouldn't have anything to do with diabetes or sugar.

.

(73) Probiotics
[2007],[Aajonus]

The probiotics

So, the probiotics add all of those kind of infinite bacterias back to the body.

Some people eat worms, some people eat fecal matter, some people eat high meat.

Meat that's allowed to grow with lots of bacteria.

There are many ways to get those probiotics.

Probiotics means living, decaying matter, pre-broken down pre-digested.

Now people ask me, why does the high meat work so quickly, 10, 20 minutes and you can go from depression to happiness like that.

Because when the bacteria feeds on those meats, it pre-digests them, it doesn't won't work on your own system.

It won't work on your own tissue.

It only works on the tissue of that meat.

When it goes through your digestive tract, you're supposed to have all those minute bacteria to do that already in your intestines.

We're pretty well robbed of it.

We poisoned our system.

Then when you get down to the bowel, you have all that E coli.

E coli is responsible for the final digestion of fat and proteins.

Reduces it to those finite molecules that feed the brain and the nervous system.

If your E coli is poor, you're not gonna feed your brain and your nervous system.

When you make high meat, the bacteria that naturally grows in it and starts free to pre-digesting it, breaks it down to those finite molecules already, so your body doesn't have to wait 16, 18 hours until he gets into the bowel.

It works immediately.

You've absorbed those proteins and those fats and those finite molecules to feed your brain and nervous.

That's why it works so miraculously.

[Attendee]

There are some companies that sell probiotics that maybe I'll just email you.

[Aajonus]

Well, there's The Primal Defense.

Their pill form is ridiculous.

Once you solidify it into pill form, all those things are dead.

The powder form it's dry.

You need to put it in juice, you need to let it start becoming alive by hydrating it with something.

It could be a little bit of fermented vegetable juice, that will help bring it back to life, but you don't wanna have the pill form and you don't wanna take the capsules that it comes in.

Take it out of the capsules if you're going to have that.

That's mainly worm casing.

There are others.

There's the EMS and that's in a liquid form.

I don't trust those because they're not from food.

They're mainly with fish and amphibians.

So, I'm not sure that they're proper for the human digestive tract.

I have not experimented with it, I'm not in a situation where I have a laboratory again to work in.

So, I won't be doing any on that until I set up the laboratory in the clinic in Thailand.

[Kathy]

When will that be.

[Aajonus]

About three, four years before it's completed?

[Kathy]

You bought the property already.

[Aajonus]

Don't wanna talk about that yet?

Those are the only two that I know about.

Those two products: EMS, and The Primal Defense.

.

(74) Pupils Wont Dshrink With Light
[2007],[Attendee]

Like, what exactly they are, how it would affect you in your everyday behaviors, if you have some shut off

Can you explain like what the drive is.

[Aajonus]

When I do the irises, pupils that don't shrink when I shine the light in their eye, that's a sign that they have certain lanes of their brain closed?

That doesn't mean that a whole area or cognitive center or motor center is shut down.

That just means there's a limited passage of information going in and out.

So, when I look at each pupil, I say that there's six lanes into that particular half of their brain.

Six lanes into the other half.

So, there's 12 lanes together, and depending upon how much that pupil will shrink, that tells me how much of the brain is open and available.

If you shine a light in the eye and that pupil doesn't shrink.

That means that brain is not open very much because it's not getting the light.

If it gets the light, if it's all getting the light that pupil's going to shrink and limit the amount of light that gets into that brain, but it doesn't make anything cognitively worse for most people.

.

(75) Red Eye, Egg White
[2007],[Aajonus]

Like I said in the book, egg white

You just put egg white in your eye and your eyes will be white quickly.

Also, if you have blurring vision, your eyes are not in good shape and you have to wear glasses, putting egg white in the eye twice a day has improved in 60% of the clients, has improved the vision by 30% in a year.

And the way I do it when I do it is I'll have an egg and a little egg white in a glass, and I dip my finger in it, so I got a little bubble of it.

Pull the lid down, rub it along the sclera on the bottom of the white of the eye on the bottom, then I'll hold the eye open like this and then I'll roll the eye around like a circus master to get all the egg white all around.

Takes about three minutes, so your eyes aren't blurred, your vision isn't blurred and the eyes are just relaxed and cool.

And then the redness just goes away.

[Jim]

You chase it with purified water or anything.

[Aajonus]

No, no, no.

You wanna leave that in there.

Egg white is 90% exactly like the tears that you make, higher in protein, and that's really good cuz then it strengthens the cornea.

And when the cornea gets weak is when it starts warping and you lose your vision.

[Jim]

I've been putting lime juice in it for ages and I felt like I should wash it out after.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's an antibacterial.

Yeah, but put egg white in to wash it out.

[Jim]

I put it in egg white, and then I put it in with a dropper.

[Aajonus]

Then you put egg white in pure by itself after that to wash it out.

.

You can use an eye dropper, but then you have to clean the fricking eye dropper.

It's a mess.

.

(76) Reminzeralize Cavity
[2007],[Attendee]

Is there anything you could do to remineralize a decalcified area that's going too far into

[Aajonus]

It's very difficult to remineralize a cavity, unless you're very young?

I've never seen anybody over 27 years old do it.

[Attendee]

So, you have to have it filled.

But I mean is that happening because of all the toxins?

[Aajonus]

All the toxins?

Yep.

And you've got to brush every.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Well, yeah!

With coconut cream.

[Attendee]

Coconut cream and the clay.

Putting the clay on at night.

[Aajonus]

I wouldn't put clay on at night.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

You said you roll-

I said just if you have an infection.

If you've got an abscess and you've got pus coming out, you put that in there.

Not as a regular thing on the teeth, cuz that'll demineralize the teeth more.

The clay will if you leave it on the tooth.

[Attendee]

Why would it be demineralize.

[Aajonus]

Because it's drying, it keeps drawing out?

[Attendee #2]

But you're wet your mouth.

[Aajonus]

You're wet in your mouth, but do you know how much absorbent clay is.

It's continuously absorbent?

[Attendee]

I gotta be putting out mercury and heavy metals in that.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but if you leave it in there thickly on your gums, it's going to demineralize your dentine.

[Attendee]

We've talked about that before, and I thought that was something you were quite heavy about.

[Aajonus]

I'm happy with you brushing your teeth with the clay, as long as you have some kind of a fat with it.

Especially the coconut cream, especially fermented coconut cream, but I'm not happy about leaving clay on the teeth very often.

[Attendee]

But you just see people that didn't like to do it cause they looked messy.

That was one, I remember discussing it.

We discussed it.

[Aajonus]

But it wasn't about leaving a lot of clay on the teeth.

Cause it will demineralize the tooth.

.

(77) Safest Tooth Filling
(78) Salt Kinds For Pool
(79) Salt Pool, Dont Use Too Much, Can Use Sand
(80) Setting Bones
[2007],[Attendee]

I dislocated my third toe, like all the way down, it's not all the way off the bone, but it's like partially off

And they were saying that I had to get x-rays done cause they didn't know if they needed to do surgery or not.

And they were saying, if I didn't get it set properly or whatever, I could develop arthritis or something.

[Aajonus]

Well, your cartilage is gonna grind itself.

Well, I broke six toes one time on a bicycle accident.

I was riding in the desert and I was going pretty fast and somebody had left their sprinkler system on all night.

So, it created an algae in the gutter, and it was just like ice.

My bike flipped out, my foot caught on the curb and ripped the toes apart.

So, they were ripped to here, broken here, here, here, and two of them here.

So, of course, I don't like to go to doctors.

So, I knew a 14 year old girl that loved to crack people's knuckles.

So, I went to visit her and she cracked my knuckles in place.

So, she just pulled, and then it's set right back where it's supposed to go.

All you need is somebody, chiropractor or somebody like that.

Your tendons will realign it, it just needs to snap out first.

I couldn't it.

I tense up when I'm going to do it, so I couldn't do it myself.

So, I had that little girl do it and she loved doing it.

.

(81) Shea Butter Is Processed
[2007],[Aajonus]

Shea butter is processed butter

[Attendee]

They say it's natural.

[Aajonus]

It's all processed, completely processed.

[Attendee]

How do they process it.

[Aajonus]

Well, they usually pasteurize it and then they steam it in some circumstances and then they spin it to get the fluid out of it, so it will cake?

[Attendee]

They tell us it's just stirred in the hot sun in Africa.

It's collected in Africa and stirred in the hot sun.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, if you believe that, that's a good one, cuz it isn't, it.

That's the way they used to make it.

That's the old way of making it.

But the butter, when you get shea butter like that, it is very foul smelling and tasting.

It tastes like eating really ripe, strong Buffalo meat, and no I've never smelled any shea butter like that in this country, it's all highly processed.

[Attendee]

The natural one smells like you said.

[Aajonus]

The natural one smells foul.

It almost smells like ozonated olive oil, but not putrid.

.

(82) Should You Eercise
[2007],[Attendee]

My question has to do with the exercise

Will exercise on your diet keep somebody in shape.

Because you said that you don't exercise, so I I'm not exercising as much as I usually do?

[Aajonus]

Well.

I'm not saying that you're not supposed to exercise.

[Attendee]

Is that better for my type to exercise.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

If you want to help your weight and get firmer, exercise.

But I look at activity rings in the eyes, that tells me how much hormones you were made to produce every day for how much physical activity.

For each activity ring, it's an hour.

That doesn't mean hour of exercise means an hour of activity.

So, I don't remember what you had.

[Attendee]

[Aajonus]

You had 6.

So, you're supposed to be busy six hours a day.

So, you could be exercising two hours a day if you want plus your regular activity.

[Attendee]

But does that mean physical exercise or you saying something.

[Aajonus]

Physical, yeah?

And singing is the most strenuous of all.

20 minutes of singing is like an hour on a treadmill.

If you're really anxious and in anxiety because you haven't burned your activity hormones for the day.

You're going to be in anxiety and you will have to burn 'em up in anxiety.

So, just start singing or start exercising, do something to burn them.

That's a misnomer, burning to utilize the energy, to utilize those hormones.

.

(83) Skinny, Tired, Trouble Digesting
[2007],[Attendee]

I've been tired for over 20

5 years.

[Aajonus]

So, you're a tired person.

[Attendee]

Yes, I am.

[Aajonus]

You're too skinny.

[Attendee]

I don't think I digest very well.

There's a time when I ate so much that the night had come up in my mouth.

I was so thin, I couldn't eat anymore.

[Aajonus]

Right.

Well, then go on, let's say three days a month or five days, three to five days a month do nothing but eggs all day long and milk before you go to bed and milk at night.

Give your intestines an entire break from meats, from digesting, and it'll also heal them from the outside in.

[Attendee]

Eggs and milk.

[Aajonus]

Eggs all day long, milk before you go to bed, and milk at night?

The milk has the cream in it to relax the nervous system because when you're detoxing heavily like that, and your time's not spent on digestion, your whole body has all this extra activity and it can cause the nervous system to get a little wired.

.

(84) Soft Cheese
[2007],[Attendee]

Amos's cheese has been very soft for the last few months, when I first got it from him a year or two ago, it used to be quite hard or not hard, but much firmer

What do you think about the very soft cheese that you can always bend it.

Is it any better or how's it working in our body when it's very soft.

I mean, it's just like butter?

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, it depends on what cheese you're getting.

What kind of cheese.

[Attendee]

Baby swiss?

[Aajonus]

I don't know why you're getting it that way cuz I get the same cheese here and it's not that soft.

I mean it's soft, but it's not that soft.

It's not creamy.

[Attendee #2]

It's a different farmers cheese.

[Attendee]

Yeah.

It's not his.

We buy the five pound block and it comes in plastic.

[Aajonus]

Where are you getting it from.

[Attendee]

Amos, but it not?

[Aajonus]

No, Amos doesn't make any.

He has several people making cheese for him.

Eli king is one of them, is his main cheese maker.

[Attendee]

And so who do you like.

[Aajonus]

I buy the same cheese?

[Attendee]

What's the name.

[Aajonus]

It's Eli's?

Eli's products, they send them, but some of the cheeses that he has, I haven't gotten any of the baby swiss that's like mush, but some of the others, it just means that it hasn't been aged 60 days.

Some of the mold is still breaking it down.

[Attendee]

I keep mine for two months and it's just the same.

[Aajonus]

Well, you have to leave it out of the refrigerator to do that, or you have to leave it out of the package in the refrigerator.

So, it'll dry, if you keep it in the plastic, it's not going to make it mature.

.

(85) Soft Vs Hard Cheese
[Attendee]

Actually, the softers are better for you, or they're not

[Aajonus]

Depends on what you need?

If you need the molds to help break down toxicity in your body, then the softer cheeses are better.

If you need a magnet and a sponge to bind with toxicity and then remove it from your body, a harder cheese is better.

[Kathy]

So, which is a harder cheese.

The farmers cheese?

[Aajonus]

Farmer's cheese is soft?

The dry cheeses, the brick cheese.

[Attendee #2]

Cheddar is hard.

[Aajonus]

Cheddar, yeah.

Jack.

Any of those.

.

(86) Some People Never Heal
Yeah, that's a problem with some people, they just do not heal cuz they don't eat good diet

You know, it took me three months of eating properly to catch up on all the loss.

Three months, then my vision started going back into its proper form again, so I wore glasses for a month and a half to read.

He may have extra scar issue that could take years and years to get rid of, but at least his leg could correct itself to where he could function better.

.

(87) Soy Milk Is Poison
[Aajonus]

Soy milk is poison

Soy milk is highly chemically processed with benzene byproducts.

So, it's all chemical.

Soy has a lot of IgG, which is a steroid in the brain, high in the brain, and it causes brain tumors in laboratory animals.

And I mean, 36% of laboratory animals got brain tumors living on soy processed for human consumption.

[Attendee]

How you get that soy outta your body.

[Aajonus]

Not easy?

You just have to just stay on a good diet for a long time and make sure you're eating enough cheese, have enough minerals to bind with it.

Eating enough, coconut cream every day.

.

(88) Steam Baths
[Aajonus]

Steam bath will damage your lungs, your mucus membranes, and it will cause your mucus to get thinner and thinner every time it burns your your lungs and your sinuses

[Attendee]

Because it's chlorine or.

[Aajonus]

Just the temperature, the steam?

The steam has to go to 212 degrees or higher.

That steam by the time you're inhaling, it's 160 degrees.

Sauna's the same way.

It's too hot.

It'll damage the vitamins and enzymes in your lungs and sinuses.

It's too hot, 102 to 105 is ideal, immersed in water.

[Attendee #2]

How do you keep the water hot.

[Aajonus]

Well, what I do to keep the water hot, I have a hot tub now back there, so I don't have to worry about that, so it’s a consistent temperature?

But when I used to use a bathtub, I would fill the bathtub with scaling hot water halfway, let it sit for about 7 to 10 minutes and it would HEAT the entire tub.

Then I would put lukewarm water in to fill the rest of the tub, and then my water would be warm and my whole tub would be warm, and the water wouldn't cool quickly.

Then I put my milk, my vinegar, my sea salt, and some coconut cream in that water to get rid of any toxins if you're using municipal water.

If you're using well water like I have, just a little milk or coconut cream, and it's all you need just to keep your skin from getting dry.

In the book, We Want To live under lymphatic baths, it tells you how much of those ingredients to put in the bathtub to neutralize poisons.

So, then when you have the bath in that situation, you get into it and go to sleep, just set a little alarm, cuz every 20 minutes, 20 to 23 minutes, you're going have to let about two inches out of the water, and then you put scalding water in and just keep it rotating.

You don't have to put any more ingredients in, but you just reheat the water about every 20 minutes and that you do that consistently for as long as you're in there and you will keep the temperature regulated.

[Fred]

The daily baths, do they have to be 102 to 105 too.

Or can they be less?

[Aajonus]

No, it could be less, but it has to be at least 101?

101 is pretty lukewarm, you know.

It's not very warm?

[Attendee]

Do you walk after those baths.

[Aajonus]

You don't have to?

Just sweating on a daily basis if you sweat a lot in the summertime, that won't do it.

It has to be the baths?

[Aajonus]

That helps, but most people don't perspire everywhere?

In the baths you perspire everywhere.

[Attendee]

Is it okay to take them at night, those 30-minute baths.

[Aajonus]

The 30-40 you can take any time of the day?

[Attendee]

If you just wanna perspire the toxins out you can do the short baths.

[Aajonus]

You can do the short baths to get it out, yeah?

That'll just dump the toxins out of the connective tissue that you throw there on a daily basis.

[Attendee]

And that's safe.

[Aajonus]

That's safe, yeah?

.

(89) Swollen Ankles and Lupus
Swollen ankles

[Aajonus]

Swollen ankles?

It depends on what the swollen ankles are from.

[Attendee]

I have lupus.

[Aajonus]

Lupus.

You don't have bad lupus?

[Attendee]

I don't know.

[Aajonus]

Let me tell you, lupus is a deterioration of the connective tissue.

People who have lupus advanced, they can't even pick up a pencil without severe pain.

[Attendee]

I was in the hospital, almost died with the kidney problem.

[Aajonus]

Uhuh.

So, you got reversed.

You reversed it on your own because medical profession doesn't know what to do with it?

[Attendee]

Right now, I feel good.

I don't take any medication.

My ankle is all swollen and I don’t know why.

[Aajonus]

Well, just put those in hot water to make sure you keep perspiring out the toxins from the ankle.

That's about all you can do, but that's good, but put some coconut cream in that water, but let's say you have a gallon and a half of hot water.

Immerse your foot in that and have about four tablespoons of coconut cream in it with some sea salt, and about a quarter cup of milk, raw milk, and that'll help.

.

(90) Teeth Whitening
[Jim]

What would you suggest for teeth whitening

[Aajonus]

Well, Terramin clay with coconut cream is the best thing you can do?

But just remember the teeth are discolored, if you don't drink tea and you're not drinking coffee and you're not smoking, most of the discoloration is coming from the brain through the nerve and the toxins are coming out.

Penicillin is one of the greatest, tetracycline is another one.

Tetracycline turns the teeth gray.

Cocaine turns the teeth gray from the inside out.

So, almost all discoloration comes from the inside out.

So, no matter how much you brush and try to whiten, unless you put peroxide on there, like they whiten teeth with, but that damages the dentine about five to 10 layers in.

So, you're damaging your dentine.

You're more likely to have cavities.

[Jim]

So, you're saying use clay like a toothpaste.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

Use it with coconut cream.

That'll help get rid of any stain that is a stain from food or from bacteria collecting, eating the food or the toxins that are coming from the brain and the body has used minerals to bind with them to cake on it.

That's what plaque is.

Plaque is toxins from the brain dumping out of the gums and the body using concentrated minerals to coat those, to keep them from damaging the dentine, and that is plaque.

If you leave that plaque on too long, the toxins like the mercury, the thimerosal, the thalium, the lead that comes out of the brain will eat through that.

It will dominate even a massive amount of alkanalizing minerals and get through and damage the dentine.

So, you still have to remove plaque.

[Attendee]

How often do you brush with the coconut cream and clay.

[Aajonus]

Whenever you want?

It's like jewelers Rouge.

.

(91) Thyroid, Heavy Metals Cause Blood Pumping
[Attendee]

My heart starts racing sometimes when I fall asleep and it seems like it's related to my thyroid

Cause if I take something for my thyroid, I don't have it, but it just hit me.

[Aajonus]

What do you take for your thyroid.

[Attendee]

It was like a supplement, like a thyroid gland?

I know you hate it, but I've taken it.

I've only take it like two, three times and then I'm okay.

[Aajonus]

Is it the freeze-dried gland or is it some medication.

[Attendee]

No, it's a freeze-dried gland?

[Aajonus]

Well, that's okay.

That doesn't mean that that's causing that.

That that's keeping the heart from racing.

The heart is racing anytime poisons get into the blood, so faster the hard pumps during a time like that, it's very difficult for a heavy metal to settle anywhere.

[Attendee]

So, it's just a heavy metal that's coming from the bloodstream.

[Aajonus]

Soon as you lie down?

[Attendee]

It's like every night.

[Aajonus]

As soon as you lie down, you have to understand, as soon as the sun goes down, your nerves start going into a detoxification.

By midnight, detoxification of the nervous system is heavy, from midnight to 5:00AM.

So, you're going to bed at the time where it's just about starting heavily.

You're getting all those metals into the blood, heart says, uhuhuh.

You're gonna do that, I'm gonna have to pump and keep that blood moving until we get enough minerals in there to bind with those heavy metals, so they don't store and damage the heart.

Cause if they get stuck in the heart, what do they do.

They'll cause a charlie horse in the heart, what's a charlie horse in the heart?

Heart attack?

And if you panic during a heart attack, you will die.

Anybody who has heart attacks, do not panic.

I've had 300 heart attacks when I had iAngina and I didn't die one, I passed out 50 times of the 300, but I didn't die.

But you've got some heavy metals stuck in your heart muscle.

You got that strychnine in there or whatever it was was, arsenic stored in your heart muscle.

[Attendee]

It's been like that for two years, but my heart, you actually can feel it.

You can see it pumping.

[Aajonus]

Actually, what you might wanna do is eat a lot of cheese before you go to bed.

Make sure you have lots of minerals about maybe an hour and a half before you go to bed, lots of cheese and honey.

.

(92) Tight Muscles From Not Exercsiing
[John]

Yeah, I've been on the raw diet about seven years as you know, I'm going through signs of detoxifications and so on

But one thing that hasn't really been resolved is like my body, I was very active in my twenties and thirties physically, and if I don't exercise regularly, my muscles just go tight.

If I don't stretch, go to the gym, exercise, they just like, they're really tight, really pull my bones out of place.

Is there any kind of dietary recommendations to address that.

[Aajonus]

Remember, like I said to him, that's a mineralization, it's a crystallizing of old cauterized minerals in the body?

It takes 40 years to get all of those out of the system.

The bones are the last thing and it takes five generations of bones to do that.

That's almost 40 years.

So, every day you're cleaning some of those out, and if they get stuck in the muscles, you're gonna get stiff.

.

(93) Trauma. Settle Down, Cream
[Aajonus]

Well, anytime you have a trauma and distress, the main thing is to settle your heart, slow it down

Cause the harder the heart pumps, the faster the heart pumps, the faster the blood goes through the kidneys and excite the adrenal glands.

So, if you settle yourself down, breathe slowly and deeply do pranayama, inhale to a count of five, hold it to a count five, exhale to a count of five you'll force yourself to come down.

Everything will settle.

And of course, to settle your nerves, the chemicals that are already rushing around in your body, drink about a half a cup of cream.

.

(94) TVs Given To Third World Countries
[Aajonus]

Believes the crap that they're told on TV

Bacteria's your enemy, it's your cause for disease and all this new generation buys it everywhere in the world, and they're indoctrinating these people because guess what.

General electric and these companies are supplying TVs?

Now I took a motorcycle, and went out all through Cambodia where there's nothing but people in grass huts, grass skirts, or their normal skirts, and they don't have much clothes on and they're kicking around a thatch ball.

They don't have anything, but yet everybody's got a fricking TV in their grass hut, and electricity going to it.

They make 50 cents a day.

The family makes 50 cents a day.

How are they paying for this TV.

Most of 'em don't have a refrigerator?

The electricity is just to run the TV because what do they learn on TV.

Drugs and, and junk food?

And in Thailand you have 20 commercials every half hour.

You have 16 to 17 minutes of commercials for every 12 minutes of program, and half of it is drug related.

So, they're teaching these people that you don't trust the human body, that everything is wrong because it's of your body and trust chemicals.

[Barbara]

So, the MMS, is it useless.

Is it a toxic product to put in your body?

[Aajonus]

Again, it's a mineral, it's mined?

It's for plants.

If you got an average person who is very toxic and they mix it with some lemon or lime yep, and have it, it's going to act like an antibiotic in a way cause of the high chlorine.

It's going to destroy some of their body's ability to cleanse itself.

Is that good.

[Barbara]

No, I don't think so?

[Aajonus]

I don't think in the long run it is, for the short term it is cuz then they get rid of their symptoms.

Then a malaria like symptom or disease will come up later, then how do they treat it.

They just keep treating it?

So, the person gets older and they may not live as long and they probably won't live as long.

.

(95) Vaginosis,
[Attendee]

The vagina and then it causes problems

[Aajonus]

Well, you just have to wear a pad, something to block it.

If you're that sensitive.

[Attendee],[unclear]

Or you come back and put inside the vagina.

[Aajonus]

You're asking for trouble,

Anything can mold that you put up there?

Even the sea sponge will start molding.

[Attendee]

What about the outside then.

[Aajonus]

Like I said, you can put something on the outside, a pad or put something in your underwear to cover it?

[Attendee]

What about coconut cream.

You mentioned with that?

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

Could I put that on the outside.

Would that help?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it will help?

Definitely will help.

[Attendee]

You don't recommend that women use tampons.

[Aajonus]

No, I don't?

I don't recommend that women use anything up them.

To collect the blood, I don't think that's a good idea, but you can put coconut cream up in you, coconut oil, things like that.

I wouldn't use olive oil up in there cause that can be a little too acidic and prevent the mucus from forming as easily.

So, as a lubricant I use coconut cream, and boy does that work really well.

[Attendee #2]

What about coconut oil?

[Aajonus]

Coconut oil?

It takes some of the sensitivity away because it's too heavy, so if you want that fine sensitivity feeling, use the coconut cream.

Coconut oil will work.

Sometimes it gets a little too hot.

You might cum too quickly with the coconut oil.

So, premature ejaculation.

[Attendee #2]

Coconut cream it is.

.

(96) Vegans and Vegetarians
[Aajonus]

Very few people do well on vegetarian

I've only met eight people out of 3,200 that did well on vegetarian.

How do they do it.

[Attendee],[unclear]

I don't know why vegans have a big raw food ?

[Aajonus]

Yep, but it's all pretty new?

I mean, David Wolfe, all of them, they're all pretty new.

David's only been on the diet 7.

5 years, and most people hit the wall at 7, but he has a high- all in those 8 people had high adrenal activity, thyroid and testosterone levels.

Even the one female that I knew fit into that category, but she started deteriorating her spine at 36 years old.

The other men that I knew, the 8 of them, their spines started deteriorating in their fifties and sixties.

[Attendee]

Are you talking about David Wolfe.

[Aajonus]

I was talking about David Wolfe, yeah?

So, David Wolf has just started eating dairy, and I'm not supposed to be telling people.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]

Laughs

One of the people who works for him called me and said, guess what.

Everybody in New York City's changing, we're going to your diet?

We're having bone loss; we're having a lot of problems.

David Wolfe, I even saw him eating cheese the other day.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

No, you did not!

Raw cheese.

No, she was already on the diet and she was doing her meat around him in the closet.

[Attendee]

Come out of the closet laughs.

[Aajonus]

No, she won’t come out of the closet cuz he's a fanatic.

You know, he doesn't admit that he's eating the cheese.

[Attendee]

She seen him eat it.

[Aajonus]

She saw him eat it?

[Kathy]

The cheese is not really a meat, the animals are not dead.

[Attendee]

It's not vegan.

[Aajonus]

But it's not vegan.

He advertises no dairy.

So, now he's eating cheese because his spine's starting to go or he's getting very demineralized.

He's feeling very nervous and shaky, not calm.

He’s eating a lot of that stuff.

All of that super food stuff is dehydrated garbage.

It's gonna de-enzyme the body.

.

(97) Vegetaslbe Juice O Nweight Loss
[Aajonus]

Something light that doesn't cause detoxification, like 90% celery, 10% parsley

.

(98) Walnut Oil
[Attendee]

Well, I was asking about walnut oil because I know you don't like vegetable oil, it hardens in the system

Does Walnut oil do the same thing.

[Aajonus]

Walnut is a fruit oil?

It won't harden as much as vegetables will, or as hard as seed oils will, but they still can be a problem in the body when they're concentrated.

When you, when you get an oil, if you really want it to be digestible for the human body, you have to ferment it.

Fermented Cod liver oil, fermented fish oils, fermented snake oil, fermented coconut oil.

All of those things come from a fermentation process.

Seal oil, it's very easy to ferment it.

All you do is take the seal meat and the blubber and you put it in a jar or the snake, you peel it and you wind it up in a glass jar and you let it sit in the refrigerator at about 48 degrees for five or six months, and the oil leaves the tissue, and then you have a pure oil that is fermented.

It has partially been broken down with the bacteria from the protein in the meat.

Doesn't taste good, and it doesn't smell good, but it is certainly good for you.

Walnut oil is just pressed, has no fermentation value to it.

If you ferment the walnut first and then press it.

Yes, you will get a good oil, but no, it won't taste good.

Because once you ferment that kind of oil, it won't taste good.

The only oil that tastes good after and during fermentation is coconut.

.

(99) Weight Loss, Carb Cravings
[Attendee]

I find that when I get into the weight loss phase I just go like carb crazy like part way through the day, and I'm like imitation, and I just have to trouble in that transition

[Aajonus]

Okay.

You're talking about my weight loss program from the book.

[Attendee]

Yeah?

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Well, some people have a hard time with that one, so I've come up with another one.

It takes weight off a little too fast, so you need to slow it down if it's coming off too fast.

Don't take advantage, I like people to be fat cause the fat protects your cells.

If you don't have fat in there, all the poisons you breathe and take in your body, they'll go into your live cells and damage your cells.

And that's where disease develops.

That's where fibromyalgia pain everywhere, fatigue sets in.

When your cells are damaged, you've got a problem.

If you have lots of fat on your body, you're protected.

So, there's my type of lady right there.

Perfect.

Healthy lady, so she is protected.

She is healthier and you've heard of that fat and happy.

[Attendee]

I've heard of dumb and happy?

[Kathy]

You could be somehow too fat.

[Aajonus]

You can’t be somehow too fat.

Well, sometimes you can be too fat.

It depends on where it all stores, if it's even like it is on her, it's perfect.

On Jan, it's quite a bit in this area.

She needs to take some of that fat that's a little too toxic.

Get rid of it and put back on some better fat.

So, a different weight loss method that's a little bit faster and usually easier for those people who can't- my weight loss in the book is designed to be slow.

This one's quicker for those people who have trouble staying on a weight loss for long because all the cravings and the craziness goes on.

So, the first thing in the morning you have a vegetable juice, about eight ounces, no more.

And in the vegetable juice, you have an egg in it.

You whip an egg in it, not blend an egg in it, but whip an egg in it.

Then every 30 minutes to 45 minutes, you eat a raw egg Rocky style or the way I do, suck it out of the shell.

[Attendee]

Every 30 minutes.

[Aajonus]

Every 30 to 45 minutes?

So, that means anywhere from 24 to 30 eggs a day, providing you’re sleeping about six hours a night.

It's not easy to sleep as much as long when you're on a weight loss.

So, you may get six hours in and then before you go to bed, now, if you really start getting weak, you need to throw at a cup of meat somewhere around six o'clock in the evening, then a cup of milk right before you go to bed and a cup of milk during the night.

You do that diet and you'll take the weight off pretty quickly.

[Attendee]

Cup of milk in the middle of the night you said.

[Aajonus]

One cup of milk in the middle of the night, one cup of milk before you go to sleep?

Now the eggs, they're digested in 16 to 23 minutes.

So, it doesn't even get through the digestive tract.

The digestive tract is all left alone.

So, the only way he gets his food is from the lymph system delivering or the blood delivering the nutrients to the intestines.

So, they don't have to work.

They can be healed with the body because there's no time and no stress and no activity by digesting the egg or very little, the body starts eating up the fat in the body quickly.

I've seen people lose 10 pounds a week on that.

I saw one person lose 18 pounds a week on that, so it's very fast.

, so don't go too wild on it.

.

(100) Weight Maintenance
[Kathy]

Now I was on this weight loss, I'm losing the weight

Now, once I go down the required amount of weight, would I be going- is it stabilizing the weight or just gaining a weight again.

What would be my diet be after I reach?

[Aajonus]

Well, it's summertime?

If you take it off while we're still in the summertime you just go to weight maintenance.

Then when it starts getting cold, then start gaining weight again.

[Kathy]

What would the weight maintenance.

[Aajonus]

Well, so your regular diet just with less fat.

You're on the weight loss right now, okay.

What did you do before you went on the weight loss?

That's what you do when you go on the weight maintenance?

[Kathy]

I don't know.

It just phase me out.

I forgot now in a way.

Well, I'll have to talk to you.

You'll be around.

[Aajonus]

Then just call me at that time and I'll give you another diet.

[Kathy]

Yeah, that's good.

.

(101) What Kind Of Meat
[Kathy]

What kind of meat should people eat

Fish or chicken or beef?

[Aajonus]

It depends on what you need?

It tells you how to make that decision in the book, We Want To Live.

If you have a very high adrenaline system, you're hyperactive and lots of energy you need the white meats.

Now white is a misnomer.

Don't consider white in the books as a color.

It is just a category, and if you had salmon or tuna or ostrich, which is red as liver, that's in the white meat category.

So, white is not a color.

It's a category.

[Attendee]

Chicken is white.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Any poultry is in the white category.

.

(102) What To Put On Cut
[2007],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Raw steak on a dried crack, would that- ⁠

No, it won't work

It'll cause a acidity sometimes and it usually won't seal it.

[Attendee]

Okay.

[Aajonus]

Only a fresh tear or cut or scrape, but I always put the lime juice on first, coconut cream, honey, and then the meat on top of that.

That's the way I do it, and it works.

.

(103) White Tongue Dry Mouth
[2007],[Aajonus]

When your body has a toxin in it, it uses a lot of calcium, phosphorous, potassium and magnesium to bind with the toxin

The example is, you plaque on your teeth and why does the body build plaque on the teeth.

Because when the brain detoxifies its heavy metals, it does it mainly out the gums and the tongue?

That's why you get that white crust on your tongue, that white plaque on your tongue.

The body will take those heavy metals that are coming from the brain, cuz the brain uses a lot of heavy metals or metallic minerals to conduct electricity and transmit light, and that's how the brain communicates, just like a computer.

So, it takes metallic minerals to do that.

So, when the metallic minerals are toxic from eating cooked foods or chemicals or any medications or preservatives, inorganic fertilizers, pollution in the air that.

Most of it goes to the brain and the system, and when it dumps, it comes out the mouth.

It's why people shrivel in the face quicker than anywhere else cuz the brain is pulling the fats all in the face.

When you're thirsty, it doesn't have anything to do with water, It's the fat being ripped out of your face.

So, you put coconut cream or butter in your mouth, some kind of a good fat that can be readily absorbable, even the fat in honey, even though it's very small is an incredible fat and it will absorb into the body.

In fact, if you make a mixture of 6 to 9 parts coconut cream to one part honey, that's a great lip gloss and that'll take care of that dry mouth and cottonmouth and thirst.

Also, takes wrinkles away from the mouth.

So, the minerals: the calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus will bind with those heavy metals as they're coming to the gum to try to protect your dentine.

So, that's what plaque is, it's a protective coating of all those minerals.

But look how many minerals it takes to do that, phenomenal amount, and if you're eating cooked foods, there's no way you'll ever keep up with that mineral loss.

(104) X Rays, How To Get Rid Of
[2007],[Kathy],[Aajonus]

By you taking the butter and the cheese and the honey out/

She asked was the x-ray is harmful to me, and would it use up nutrients

Of course?

That's why I didn't go back and I'm gonna wait till my leg completely heals before I do the other x-rays to show people how the leg can heal without medical help, but I'm gonna wait till the leg is completely healed because any x-ray slows healing.

That's why I didn't want to have the x-ray, but the leg was in such bad shape, and I mean, it looked terrible.

Knotted here.

It looked like the leg has been completely twisted and broken.

So, that's why I had the x-rays because I wanted it put back in place, but it was in place.

[Kathy]

So, what do you just get rid of that x-ray poison.

[Aajonus]

I ate the avocado and orange together?

[Kathy]

Oh, that's right.

[Aajonus]

To get rid of the radiation.

I didn't do that until after two weeks of eating the pineapple mixture.

When I stopped eating the pineapple mixture, I started eating the avocado and orange together to get rid of the radiation, but I'm sure it slowed it down a bit, the healing process.

(105) Yeast Infection and Homemade Kefir
[2007],[Attendee]

It hurts when it flares up

[Aajonus]

Well, when you have that combination put a tablespoon of lime juice in it in.

Because remember, the urethra is the last tract of the urinary tract.

So, it's going to be the last place to defend itself against any of those high yeasts, those fungus that you have in the body.

She was a vegetarian for a very, very, very long time.

Full of all these sugars, that fungus feed on very easily.

So, when you get down to the end of the urinary tract or any part of the body, it's going to receive fewer nutrient and, lime juice will help destroy fungus.

So, just put a tablespoon of lime juice in there and the.

The formula that I give in the newsletter it's a less dangerous way of doing it and of using lime juice on a weekly basis.

So, go with that if you want to destroy.

If you've ever had antibiotics in your life, you wanna do that one day a week.

That formula on the newsletter for destroying fungus.

You put the lime juice, mix it in the cream and honey.

[Attendee]

And also, I need to say one thing about douching because I noticed, especially women that get bacteria in the back through the vagina area and I wanna if that also will help.

[Aajonus]

Well, you've got a lot of fungus that are still discarding into that area?

So, the best way to douche is to take a kefir that you've made, not a foreign kefir.

You don't want to use a foreign kefir grain in this, you want the natural bacteria because the grain bacteria works against your natural bacteria.

It will even eat the natural bacteria.

The bacteria that grows in milk naturally will not do that.

So, that's why I like to just encourage honey.

It helps those bacteria grow quickly.

So, you just take that and dilute it with a little Gerolsteiner water.

You don't shake it up.

You just stir it just lightly in there, so you don't lose all the carbon, and then you douche with that.

You can use a teaspoon of lemon and a teaspoon of lime juice mixed in the kefir before you mix it with the Gerolsteiner and then douche with that.

(106) You Can Exercsei Too Much
[2007],[Aajonus]

Well, this diet, it is a miracle, but it isn't magical

So, you still have to be reasonable.

[Attendee]

I can't exercise too much as long as I keep my gut.

[Aajonus]

No, you can exercise too much because you can spend all of your energy on exercise, then your body's not gonna heal and detoxify?

[Attendee]

I was hoping to take a 1800 mile bike ride for two weeks.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Then take off for a few weeks after, slow down for a few weeks after, maybe only do two hours a day after that for three or four weeks or a month, just to let your body catch up if you're gonna do something intense like that.
