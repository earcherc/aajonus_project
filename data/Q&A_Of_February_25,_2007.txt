(1) 1 Tbsp A Day Of Oil
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, your oils, because they're oils, they have no water-soluble fats in them

So, they have a tendency to cause the body to choke itself, to not allow oxygen through the skin, so they can be used medicinally.

And they're mainly solvents for cleaning the body.

The body will use some alcohol with them to make soaps, to clean the body.

So, it's good to use it only medicinally.

One tablespoon of one of those a day, or if you're gonna use it for like a meat sauce or you're gonna have a lot of olive oil in a sauce, to have 4 to 5 tablespoons of sauce that you use 'em to two meat meals that day, then don't have anything three or four days or five days, more oils again.

So, oils are very concentrated, so you have to be careful.

Butter is not, you can use a couple sticks a day.

All the animal fats are fine.

.

(2) Aajonus Detox & Hit By Crowbar
[2006],[Aajonus]

First, I'm gonna talk about it if everybody sees, I'm a little swollen over here and sagging

Friday night, I started going into a heavy detoxification.

I was in Bangkok three years ago in December and I was hit with a crowbar here.

They were trying to get my movie camera and they knocked the bone that connected from here to here.

All the way back under my tongue.

So, it took an hour of surgery to pull it back, to wire my jaw, and to wire the teeth back in, they wanted to just cut the bone out.

They said it will never heal.

The tube of nerves that went to the teeth was severed in two places, and they say that will never reconnect the tooth.

The tooth and the, and the bone will rot and it'll kill you because it can go to the brain.

I said, you don't know me and you don't know my diet.

So, if it goes into necrosis, I will have it removed after so many weeks.

So, they put it back in place and my teeth are there, and the bones solid.

But I accepted Novocain, which is something I don’t do and I accepted it because the pain was so excruciating cause I had to pull the bone all the way from under my tongue and pull it back and work it back in because they had stretched it out of place.

So, pulling the jaw apart and putting the bone in was pretty painful, so I allowed them to give me six shots of Novocain.

So, the Novocain lodged here in the bone and it started popping out on Friday.

So, Saturday, this thing was this big, and it's already gone down to this.

Now, when I had Novocain in the past, you know, pre-1972, the Novocain, when it would come out, I'd have a detox like this last sometimes for two weeks.

21 days, three weeks.

So, this is very quick.

It was very painful for one day, but I was able- I saw patients yesterday, did a lot of work yesterday, so I'm getting healthier and healthier and healthier, even though I'm turning 60 in two months.

.

(3) Aajonus Flying Schedule
[2006]

Coming back in April

[Aajonus]   Well, no?

I have to fly from Asia to Hawaii on the 27th cause I'm doing a workshop.

I'm seeing patients in Hawaii.

So, I'll be back the 1st or 2nd of May.

And then I'm only back for two days.

Then I go to Omaha back for two days, then I go to St.

Louis back for two days, go to Chicago back for two days, go to Phoenix back for four days.

Then go to Washington DC for two and a half months, which I'm not gonna be around much.

Yeah.

[Attendee]   When you go to Phoenix, are you doing like lectures and stuff.

[Aajonus]   I do a lecture and see patients?

[Attendee]   Would that be on your website.

[Aajonus]   He's gonna have it up there?

I publish everything two months before the event.

I'm gonna send you a list of everything ahead of time.

Because I don't like to send them out to everybody else until two months ahead.

I found if I do it more than two months, they can lose everything.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   So, you’re gonna be gone for almost-

Five and a half months.

When I get back from Washington, DC, I have to go to Cincinnati to do a lecture workshop there, and then I go to Aspen and then I'll be back the end of August.

[Attendee]   So, we get to fly Aspen in Phoenix and Washington DC, just to listen to you.

[Aajonus]   Absolutely?

I do have people who do that.

[Jim]   Are you gonna be able to edit the footage.

[Aajonus]   I hope to get most of it pre-edited all in there?

While I'm here, I don't have any time.

[Attendee]   So, a quick question.

I know as you do consulting services, can you give us a rundown, like how you do it or what you do or what's recommended.

[Jim]   It's on the site?

[Aajonus]   So, what I do is I photograph the irises, and that tells me what's in the body, and I look at the hands to see how the glands are working, how much congestion there is compared to what's in the eye.

It's like a two-analysis viewpoint, and then I give people a diet that.

Takes about an hour and 15 minutes.

The first time it is $300 and I like to see people once a year, just so they can see how they've done and the changes in the eyes.

So, I pull them up there together and they get to see the changes, like this couple.

I'm talking about the couple that left early.

They drove down, it was 18 months since they had a reading and the changes in their eyes were extraordinary.

Especially in hers cause she does the diet 90%, he does it 60%.

So, and you can see the difference in what he did and what she did.

She was overall healing and cleansing.

He was overall mainly cleansing.

.

(4) Aajonus Hobby Was Cooking
[2006]

And that's what I used to do before I got into raw foods

As a matter fact, of that was my hobby, cooking.

Bt then when I got into raw foods, everything was so tasty compared because when you cook a food, it destroys the taste buds in it, everything that was alive, it breaks it down and goes flat.

That’s why they add all this salt and all flavorings to everything because once you process and cook the food it's cardboard, tastes like cardboard, there's no flavor.

So, of course they have to flavor it to get you to eat it.

So, I eat just straight.

The only thing I really don't like, and don't like to eat alone without some kind of spice with it is kidney because of the ammonia.

I hate the taste of ammonia.

It just tastes terrible, kidney tastes terrible to me.

So, I'll either blend it with a lot of other glandsand those glands are very good.

When I was in Nevada city, I had a friend who shot a deer.

I butchered it, so I took the brain and I took all the glands and everything and made a big gland shake with all this mixture.

I had done a workshop and two days of consults all the way from the morning, eight o'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock at night, and then a few that day, and I was supposed to get some rest, take a nap and go pick up my girlfriend at Reno airport.

So, that was about an hour and a half, two-hour drive, and it was gonna be in the evening at night and because he shot this deer, I had to butcher it because nobody else knew how to skin and butcher a deer or any animal.

None of these people had seen a farm, much less know what to do.

So,   I butchered this deer and put all the glands in, so I didn't get my nap because I spent three hours skinning and butchering this whole deer and including getting the brain out, which is still pretty fast because your average person wouldn't know how to do.

Could take 6 to 12 hours to do it, and I did in three hours.

Of course I butchered a lot, so I just knew how to go through it, all the parts, butchered  the steaks and everything.

Had the entire thing butchered in three hours, every piece of it, every section.

So, made that glandular shake.

So, I had about a cup and a half the glandular shake.

I got so high.

Got to the Reno airport, picked up my girlfriend, didn't get to the hotel light till like two o'clock in the morning, and we had sex for three hours and I still didn't wanna go to sleep, but she was really tired.

So, that's what that kind of shake can do for you, really drive the energy up.

.

(5) Advacnes Glycation End Products
[2007],[Aajonus],[Attendee]

Just one more aspect of the question regarding thirst and vegetable juice

If like carbo vegetables, like carrot, beet, or other root vegetables, do they have destructive factor of advanced glycation end products if I have too much vegetable juice or is that mostly due to bread.

[Aajonus]   Vegetable juice, anything that's high in carbohydrates, even fruit, fresh fruit?

Anything that has a high glycemic level, anything that is high in carbohydrates.

Your body will convert so much of that into glycogen, which runs the brain and nervous system.

The end process of the body using glycogen is advanced glycation end products and your body stores 70% to 90% of that for a lifetime.

So, when you drink carrot juice, beet juice.

Any of those high glycemic vegetables, it creates the advanced glycation end products.

The only way you can avoid that- mainly in my vegetable juices that I suggest in the book, it's mainly celery.

There's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery, so it's a negative.

So, you put a little carrot in there.

You put the high glycemic parsley n there, it comes to an even balance.

So, there's no excessive carbohydrate, so your body can never make it into glycogen to fuel the brain and nervous system.

When your body uses meat or eggs to form glycogen, it does it with a help of glucagon and there's a very low carbohydrate index like 8% and we can handle about 12% at a time.

So, it doesn't store any of the advanced glycation end products, what little it does make from eggs and meat.

That's why I say you need to not eat high carbohydrate foods in any concentration before six hours passed, for first six, seven hours of the day.

Because the body has made all the glycogen for the day in that first six to seven hours.

So, you have a vegetable juice, that's a negative or an even, you're not gonna generate any from it.

Then you go to a meat meal, which doesn't have any in it, except if you are using a little honey and only 10% of the honey, as long as it's unheated above 93 degrees, then only use 10% of that honey will be high in carbohydrate.

And most of that will go to be utilized in digesting the fat and not into making glycogen.

Then you go from that to a milkshake and you've got enough cream and fats in there, so the sugars and carbohydrates will be used to digest the fat rather than to make glycogen.

So, then after that you have another juice.

So, you're not having anything with high fruit on it until 1:30 PM, 4:30 PM, somewhere between that area.

So, you haven't allowed your body to make glycogen from high carbohydrate foods and your brain will stay clear and functional.

If you have those advanced glycation end products in any concentration, it causes the neurological fluid and the blood to get very sticky.

And if you see them going, passing each other, the blood cells, there's so many of them, they’re just like swimming together or moving together in this current of blood, and you see them stick together when the blood's like tha.

And the brain and the nerve fluid, it's the same way.

And you get synapse that fire and the fluid sticks and may go to the wrong brain center than where you've directed it.

Oh, I want this memory.

Well, it shoots off into the wrong memory station and all of a sudden you don't know where that went.

You don't have the word or the phrase or the memory, the event that you were looking for, and it's not there because the brain's too sticky.

So, that prevents that by eating that progression.

So, yes, if you had all carrot juice in the morning, you'd be screwing your thinking process.

.

(6) Amish Foods and Whols Foods
[2007],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]   What's the best source to get the raw cheese, eggs here in town?

Which stores?

[Aajonus]   You mean in the valley?

None?

[Attendee]   Where do you get your stuff.

[Aajonus]   I go over to our Rawsome club in Venice and James has an Amish truck that comes from Pennsylvania, an Amish group of farmers that supply us?

There are about seven farmers and Amos Miller is the one that handles organizing, getting all of it for us.

We have a truck that comes out once a week, and delivers to us.

[Attendee]   Whole foods.

[Aajonus]   Whole foods is all bullshit, literally?

Whole foods is a company out of Texas, and let me give you an idea of their thinking.

I called them and asked them what they were feeding their all-natural beef, no hormones and no antibiotics.

“Oh, we’re feeding them silage and grain.

”  And I said, “What grain.

” And they said, “Mainly wheat”?

And I said, “Okay, what form is the wheat.

Do you crack it?

Do you process it?

What form is it?

” They said, "Well, we don't know?

” And I'd tell they were lying by that.

And I said, “Okay, who are your producers.

” So, I called their suppliers of beef and found out they were feeding them 15% bakery waste, boiled and oiled donuts, stale donuts?

So, I called whole foods back and I said, “You can't call that all natural.

What cows do you know go around eating donuts.

” “Well, the donuts are made of grains of wheat.

” That's their thinking.

And if you look in whole foods, all their advertisements, go organic, go organic.

You look at their produce.

How much produce do they have that’s organic.

2%?

You go into Wild Oats, 50% or more of their produce is organic.

So, you realize the whole foods is nothing but one of those spin doctor kind of advertising company that we just want you to get to buy the shit at a higher price, and that's all it's about.

[Attendee]   Well, at least they have the milk, the butter, the eggs.

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

Well, they will carry some of that.

[Attendee #2]   How about the, like a New Zealand line.

That's still good that they sell there, right?

[Aajonus]   Yep, absolutely?

Yeah.

That's good.

[Attendee #2]   What about the Iceland stuff.

[Aajonus]   Iceland is fine, but you have to be careful, often it's frozen from Iceland?

.

(7) Arnold Shwartzneggar Is Sagging and Aajonus Exercise
[2006],[Aajonus]

Because they've melted everything

You just pumped up with all this mineral toxicity, bloated with all this mineral toxicity.

Once they stopped, that's it.

I mean, look at Arnold Schwarzenegger, anybody see that?

I saw picture of him.

[Attendee]   Mr.

University, and what he looks like now, right.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

I mean, you're talking 50 years difference or 40 years difference, and you know, this guy still works out and stuff is just sagging.

I don't work out at all.

I havent' worked out since 1979 and everything is just tight as it can be, and this is my exercise on my computer.

I do carry my groceries once a week.

Carry some milk.

That's it.

.

(8) Arrowhead Water
[2007],[Aajonus],[Abraham]

Since she asked about water, Arrowhead is just not good

If you add apple vinegar to, could you drink yet.

[Aajonus]   I wouldn't drink it?

Just remember that all of Arrowhead water is reclaimed.

See the city of San Bernardino has a contract, indefinite lifetime, 99-year contract for all of the Arrowhead water.

So, Arrowhead reclaims it after the city of San Bernardino uses it.

Full of all the chemicals and everything from the industry, re-bottles them and sells it to you as fresh spring water when it isn't.

[Abraham]   So, my question is doesn't the vinegar help neutralize some of those toxins.

[Aajonus]   It'll help neutralize some of those toxins, but that's for a bath, not to drink?

I never recommend drinking municipal water anywhere.

.

(9) Bioeditcal Hormones, Pig Organs
[2007],[Aajonus]

Bioidentical is another misnomer bullshit sales thing

The only way you're gonna get bioidentical is if they take him out of your blood and they give him right back to you, that's the only bio identical.

So again, we've got this chemistry bullshit language that's getting you to believe that you're gonna be getting something that's natural to you.

They're taking hormones out of a plant.

Do you have hormones.

Are they identical to a human?

No?

It is absolutely preposterous.

If you want something that's closer to the human, you eat glands of an animal, glands of a pig.

Pig and the human are the most alike.

[Attendee]   It’s okay to eat pigs.

[Aajonus]   Oh yes?

As long as you know him.

As long as he is organic.

.

(10) Bioidentical Progresterone
(11) Blood Clot, Chest Pain, Medical Prosfession
[2007],[Aajonus],[2007],[Aajonus]

Yeah, I know

Whole Foods is purchasing Wild Oats.

I was told last week, you know, so there it goes.

[Jim]   My grandfather died from a blood clot.

[Aajonus]   In the heart, head.

[Jim]   In the heart?

[unlcear] for it to thin it down.

And they sent me off for the prescription and they check on me every once in a while.

I’d go in, I get my blood drawn and they have a scale too thick, too thin or in the middle or whatever.

And a lot of times I come out too thick, even though I'm taking those pills.

[Aajonus]   You shouldn’t be taking those pills, that's all bullshit.

[Jim],[Aajonus]   Well, I gotta do something about it because-

No, you don’t.

You believe their garbage that that was had to do with a heart attack.

[Jim]   It's not a heart attack.

It's an embolism.

It's a clot.

[Aajonus]   There's no clot in your blood.

Your blood cannot clot because of the diet you're on.

It's impossible for it to clot, impossible for it to dry out, impossible.

[Jim]   How did I get those chest pains.

I was pretty much on the diet?

[Aajonus]   You probably had uric acid build up in those muscles.

[Jim]   No, they did a scan and they saw the clots and all that stuff.

[Aajonus]   I would like to see the clots.

I'm telling you there was no clots in there.

If you had clots, you would've felt it all the way down the end of your hand.

[Jim]   There were sharp pains in the chest.

[Aajonus]   That doesn't matter.

If you had clots, it would cut the circulation off to your hand.

Your fingers would go instantly numb.

So, they were lying to you.

They may have seen congestion, but they weren't clots.

You have to take what the medical profession tells you as their program by the pharmaceutical industry.

The pharmaceutical industry has one purpose, that's to get you to take their medication, and that is it.

[Jim]   With the medicine, they gave you a film and they show you how to take the medicine and to make sure nothing interferes with taking the medicine.

So, when I'm looking at it is I need, I need to reorientate my daily intake so that things don’t cause my proble, steer away from it.

[Aajonus]   That didn't cause your problem, your sick blood didn't cause that problem.

Do you know how thick Aboriginal is.

[Jim]   Well, I mean, something caused a problem?

It was sharp pains, like gunshot pains and my breathing was restricted and I had to do something about it.

[Aajonus]   Well, pains in your chest will do that.

If you have a hharlie horse, do you think you've got a blood clot.

[Jim]   No?

[Aajonus]   Okay.

That's what you were having up here.

You were having spasms in your muscles up here.

It's not a heart attack.

[Jim]   No, I'm not saying it's a heart attack.

Heart attack is different than a clot heart attacks.

[Aajonus]   But clots cause heart attacks.

[Jim]   Well, I'm worried about it in the brain or something like that, where it kills you right away.

[Aajonus]   Okay.

Not going to happen.

They put the average person in fear.

That's the way to put you in fear, and then you take medication.

Your blood thick is a very good thing.

If it's sticky and thick, that's a problem.

But if it's not sticky and thick, you're not gonna have a problem.

[Attendee]   How can you tell if it's sticky.

[Jim]   Yeah, I’m not going around cutting myself to see?

[Aajonus]   Well, you just prick yourself and if it's very sticky after it starts dryying, then that means you're eating too much carbohydrate or you're detoxing too much carbohydrate.

[Jim]   Well, if I cut myself shaving or something, it, it doesn't bleed all over.

I mean, it's just regulates right away.

[Aajonus]   You don't have a problem.

[Jim]   So, shouldn't, I have more juice or eat more grapefruit or.

[Aajonus]   Absolutely not?

You got a pain like that.

You drink some raw cream, put a hot water bottle there, make sure the circulation gets through.

Because you've got uric acid built up in the tissues.

That's what causes all spasms, all pains.

Unless you have mercury that got free, let's say you had mercury in a muscle or in some fat in some muscle and it got free and it burned.

That's gonna feel like a stabbing pain.

[Jim]   There was a swelling in my leg this time and also a couple years before that they say was related to it somehow.

In other words, the clot got to traveling in the circulatory system.

[Aajonus]   That's the way they're taught to think.

Look at my swelling here.

Think that’s a blood clot.

I've got a bone situation here from a chemical?

Immediately when this started happening, I tasted the Novocain, and I smelled just like it was after he shot me up with that Novocain cause you can smell Novocain.

You know what it smells like.

That odor came right through my nose once that happened.

Don't buy it.

Don't buy their stuff.

You got problem like that, you give me a call.

[Jim]   Well, I don't wanna die unnecessarily.

[Aajonus]   I had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15.

5 and 22 before I changed my diet to mainly a raw one, 300 heart attacks.

50 of them put me unconscious, no medical assistance at any time.

Do you know what the doctor said.

It was all in my head?

You know why.

Because they look for congenital malformation of the heart or congestion?

If they don't see those, they don't see anything.

They don't see after an injection, mercury goes in, stores in the heart muscles.

Every time you breathe, every time circulation goes into there, a few of those molecules are released, burn the muscle cells and cause a tightening, a cramping, a charlie horse, right in the heart, painful as can be.

And they said it was in my head because it wasn't congenital.

It wasn't congested.

They never look for the poisons that they put in the body purposefully.

You have to disregard what they say completely.

It's like say you want to become a multimillionaire; do you guy go to the guy on the corner that flips hamburgers to get his suggestions.

He'll never tell you how to become a millionaire?

You go to somebody who's good at it.

Donald Trump or somebody like that, or JP Morgan, somebody like that or the Rockefellers, but you certainly don't go to your friendly corner flapjack flipper.

And that's when you go to the medical profession for health and wellbeing, that's what you're doing.

Because they know nothing about health, they know drugs.

They're legalized drug pushers.

They know diseases, how to identify what they can see, but all this chemistry bullshit is these formulas that have been created by these people who are paid to come up with formulas, to get other people, to get other people, to get those people, to get other people to take medication.

And they don't get paid unless they come up with a formula that says you have to take my medication.

.

(12) Blood Thinners, High Blood Pressure
[2007],[Aajonus]

You know what that'll do

That could thin your brain tissue, could thin your veins, and then all of a sudden you have a bleed; you have an aneurysm and that's it?

Remember all the people with high blood pressure.

They say, “Well, high blood pressure causes aneurysms.

Cause heart attacks.

” Right.

So, they have all this medication for all these years to lower blood pressure?

Well, in December, the test from the UK came out from 45,000 people who were tested.

Half of them had high blood pressure was given medication, the other half were not given medication.

ll of the heart attacks occurred in the people who were taking medication, but they didn't say it that way.

What they did was the people who had 110 to 120 diastolic pressure had all the heart attacks.

Those that had a solid rate of one 160 to one 170 had no heart attacks.

High blood pressure keeps you from having heart attacks.

That's why you have high blood pressure because you have some kind of congestion in your arteries and veins, so you need to expand them, so your blood flows properly.

If you take blood thinners, you thin the walls, then they tear and you've got aneurism.

.

(13) Cadmium, Kindey Cancer, How Many Minerals To Get Rod If Toxins
[2006],[Aajonus]

Cadmium is almost in any industrial process there is

So, cadmium usually creates kidney cancer and some other cancers, but kidney cancer's most prominent from cadmium and smoke tars.

So, you have one molecule of cadmium, it may take 50 calcium molecules, 5 potassium, about 7 magnesium to bind with one.

So, you know how many minerals you're using just to take care of the pollution.

So, you have to have a lot of minerals in our environment, especially living in this city.

There are more vehicles in this city than any other city in the world.

.

(14) Celery and Carrot Juice
[2007],[Aajonus],[Attendee]

I noticed in the book you have certain recipes for vegetable juice, is there any other ones that you recommend

[Aajonus]   It depends upon a condition?

Those are the main that anybody can relate to if they have the problems that I suggested there, but you could pick up Walkers Vegetable Juice Book and then see what he recommends for certain conditions.

[Attendee]   Yeah, he's got carrot and everything.

[Aajonus]   Yes, but you only want to use a little bit of carrot.

[Attendee]   He’s got turnips and beets.

[Aajonus]   You just use a small amount of those if you're gonna use them.

No more than 10% of your juice.

If it's something strong, like leaks, cilantro, kale, any of those are really hot and strong.

You want to use no more than 5% of your juice.

[Attendee]   Somewhere there's like a list of like how much carbohydrates are in vegetables.

[Aajonus]   Well.

I think that the USDA has a book on that and you can download it.

It has an index on that.

But, you know, you use salary and that's your negative.

So, you can use higher carbohydrate things, it’s just the celery will bring it down.

Like sometimes I'll give somebody 20% of their juice as carrot, but it has 60% or 70% celary to bring that down.

But I know that that person can handle more high carbohydrates without ending up in the brain.

So, they have a lot of bile in their body and that bile needs to be removed.

A lot of that high carbohydrates gonna be used to digest the carotene to neutralize the bile.

So, you're getting heavy into chemistry there and you better know your chemistry if you’re screwing with something like that.

But if you have very yellow skin any particular time, it means you're throwing off a lot of bile, a higher amount of carrot juice would be fine.

Just make sure you use celery as your negative base.

.

(15) Cereal Is Nutrient Enriched
[2007],[Attendee]

But if it’s all this chemical, why would they bother putting it in cereal

[Aajonus]   You have to understand the damage that they do when they process a cereal to make it into a long shelf lasting food?

There's nothing alive left in it.

They destroy all the vitamins in it.

So, then what they do is we came into this in the 60s.

We got into the nutrient enriched food.

Now when it first came out, it was McGovern mcg.

McGovern came out and he was the head of the committee on nutrition and he said we have to have chemically free food; we need to do this and do this and do that.

Eat less red meat and stuff like that.

He was from Iowa, that's a farming state, so he got them crazy, and of course he didn't win the election.

The next election of Senator or anything else.

He didn't win the election because the whole farming communities and the states were against him from that.

From that incident, it became a nutrient science.

Well, this has vitamins in it that says vitamin A, this says vitamin D and they forgot all the other nutrients.

They would plug just certain vitamins and certain nutrients and they would sell you on that, oh, this has got this and this in this food.

And it's a sales pitch.

It's to get you to buy it when it's no good.

Anything that claims we've got good nutrients in this, stay away from it as far as you can away from it, because you know, it's one of the worst foods you can buy.

It has no nutrient value and they're putting just a few in and they're chemical too, and they're just selling you a product.

That's what it's all about.

All those third world countries, all the care packages you send, all the care you give.

They go to Kellogg’s and Purina and general foods and buy the worst cereals in the world.

Powdered milks, give it with water.

To these third world children.

They get tape worms, they get diabetes, they have all these kind of diseases and they kill them.

(16) Cheese Before Anything If Mercury Dumping
[2007],[Attendee]

How much cheese are you talking about

[Aajonus]   Depends upon the person?

I tell people, they have mercury formaldehyde and aluminum in their stomach, like from vaccines.

I tell them to eat cheese 10 minutes before they eat anything, unless they're drinking milk in between meals.

And then with the meat meal, I suggest eating at least a tablespoon too with a meat meal.

And then after the meat meal to have minerals that you absorb from the cheese, you eat cheese and honey together.

The honey to the cheese is one third honey to the cheese.

One tablespoon of cheese.

It's one teaspoon of honey.

.

(17) Cheese To Detox
[2007],[Attendee]

You told me to eat sugar cubed size of raw cheese unsalted salted, and when I do it I love it because when I do it, my mouth becomes so watery, and I have to keep swallowing it

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

But that's a different kind of thing.

That's getting the poisons out of the brain and into the cheese rather than your system.

And I don't like people chewing their cheese all that much because it'll pull all the poisons out of the brain, and I want the cheese to absorb most of the poisons that are dumping into the stomach intestines.

So, you don't want to chew it so much that you get a very liquid, unless like this.

Now in order to get this to go down fast, so it was this big yesterday at this time, it was this big, all the way over.

And my whole eye was swollen up.

So, I just started eating the cheese and getting it till it was completely liquid, my mouth was full and then I spit it out.

And by nighttime, this had gone down by 70%.

And then this morning, another 10%.

So, you can use cheese as a, as a way to absorb and get rid of poison.

.

(18) Chickens and Cows Eat Grains
[2007],[Aajonus]

Chickens eat grains

That's for the birds.

That’s who eat grains on this planet, mainly are birds.

I've seen cows out in the pasture, as soon as the grains dry on the grass and it hits the ground.

That's the first thing they'll suck up, but they may not get more than no more than two cups of grain a day.

And that's what they're usually fed in milking time, so that's fine.

.

(19) Citric Acid Cycle, Macronutrients
[2007],[Aajonus]

I was talking about the Citric acid cycle

When your body uses fat as energy, it uses fat as 80% of that chemical combination.

It uses pyruvate 8% to 15% and vitamin C or carbohydrate is 5%.

That combination is the perfect ideal combination to get the most amount of energy.

[Attendee]   What is pyruvate.

[Aajonus]   Pyruvate is a sugar made from protein that has no high advanced glycation byproduct?

[Attendee#2]    I'm sorry.

Pyruvate was what again.

[Aajonus]   Pyruvate is a sugar made from protein, it's a protein sugar?

[Attendee]   Do you buy that or it comes from a combination of foods or.

[Aajonus]   Your body makes it from protein?

[Attendee]   So, you would feed your body protein and fats.

[Aajonus]   It makes pyruvate?

So, your diet, as far as sugar needs, high carbohydrate needs is only 5% high carbohydrate foods.

That’s why you have one fruit meal a day and that handles it.

[Attendee]   So, the point of this whole pyruvate thing, what was that.

[Aajonus]   Well, there wasn't any point?

It was just to show you that you need very little carbohydrates.

.

(20) Corn Fed Meat
[2007],[Aajonus]

Corn-fed chicken and corn-fed beef, my grandparents raised them

We had 52 acres of corn that we raised every year, and we fed that to the dairy cause they owned a dairy farm that fed all the cities within a hundred miles West of Chicago and ago.

We fed the cows corn during milking and then grass that we grew on some other acres.

We had a silo that was about 55 feet high, and we fill it every year with corn and we'd just take the husks off cause it would mold.

So, we'd just take that off, but leave the corn on the cob and then give it to the cows cause the cows love that center of the cob, it’s like sugarcane, so it's really sweet.

They could digest the corn and make it into an acetone, which is a fat substance.

It's like chickens that are fed corn, it makes that very yellow, fat, so tasty.

And you can't get that with soy.

.

(21) Cramps From Not Enough Fat
[2007],[Aajonus]

Same thing with me

I go over to Thailand.

I've got three girlfriends over there.

So, one at night, sometimes all three on the same day cause they don't last.

I don't know, women just there don't, they can't take much fucking, so they get sore easily.

So, and when I get into it, I get into it.

So, all of a sudden, at the end of that time that I'm there.

I get thinner because I don't have my milk.

I take lots of butter with me and I eat lots of meat fat, but it still doesn't put on the weight like the milk does.

So, then I'll start getting more cramps in my feet and my calves.

[Attendee]

When my weight's going thinner, I get the more cramps.

[Aajonus]

Yep.

That's it.

So, that's why I like to get as fat as I can before I go.

I'm working on it.

But you know, the last time I came back, I was a30 inch waist, in June when I returned.

Now I'm up to a 37 inch waist.

I'm getting ready.

[Jim]

So, on the weigh, that would be a good thing for me.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely.

That's what I said.

To get the urea out, you can use the whey.

That can thin your blood as long as you're not getting too acidic.

[Jim],[Aajonus]

So, every time I have a juice, I could just-

Put a little whey in.

Yeah.

[Jim]

And how about whey before I go to bed or if I wake up in the middle of the night, something like that is that.

[Aajonus]

Don't have too much of it.

If you're having cramps everywhere in your body, then you've got urea building up.

If you're not having that, thickened blood is not your problem.

[Jim]

What is my problem.

[Aajonus]

Your problem is you have some urea built up in your chest?

.

(22) Doctors Used To Be Better
[2007],[Aajonus]

Even when I was a kid, our family doctor used to sit there and sometimes it would take him a week before he'd make a decision on what the problem was and what could be done about it

Too often he would resort to penicillin because he didn't know his butt from a hole in the ground, but at least he did some thinking before he made any decision.

Yeah, these guys, “Oh, this is the latest thing for that.

Pop this pill, pop this combination?

That didn't work.

Here's another set.

” And that's the way it goes.

[Attendee]   In other countries they don't do that.

[Aajonus]   No?

Well, they're doing it in a lot of other countries.

[Attendee]   Nothing compare to Americans.

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

Nothing like here.

Definitely.

[Attendee #2]   They give you these pills saying, tell me what happens.

[Aajonus]   Yes.

See how this works.

You're a guinea pig.

.

(23) Drinking Whey
[2007],[Attendee]

But that's okay

[Aajonus]

Not really?

You have to be careful with that too.

It's very acidic, whey is very acidic.

Whey is when you separate the curds from the liquid, it looks kind of like a chartreuse color, kind of greenish yellow.

That's whey, that's the liquid.

It's very concentrated in lactic acid, so it helps break down minerals that clump together that can cause stones.

And it also helps get neutralize urea, uric acid that builds up in the muscles, it causes muscle cramps.

When people are exercising a lot or they have poor cleansing after heavy metabolism or exercise and they get charlie horses.

That's from urea, uric acid building up in the muscles and the muscle gets so acidic from it, it contracts.

Well, the whey and the lactic acid in it helps neutralize that urea, the uric acid.

They're both acid though, so it creates an acidic condition that can start dissolving cells, start dissolving your muscles.

That's why those people who take all those whey powders to build muscles, soon as they stop exercising, all of a sudden everything goes sag.

.

(24) Dry Mouth
[2007],[Aajonus]

Now most people drink because their mouth gets dry

Remember that when I said that when the brain has the most toxins, heavy metal toxins, when it detoxifies it does it through the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands.

It rips all of the fats out of the face.

That's why you see people shrivel up in the face.

Because all those poisons are dumping out the mouth and it's taking all the fats in the localized area with it.

Why do you think people wrinkle in the face so much and they don't wrinkle in other parts of the body as they do the face.

Because it's getting the least fat?

It's ripping more fats out of it than anywhere else.

There are two things you can do.

You can eat some butter and honey together to help lubricate that area.

The quickest fat to lubricate this area is in honey.

With coconut cream, if you use like 10 tablespoons of honey with 1 tablespoon of coconut cream, it just turns it into a cloudy honey.

And you put that on your lips and as you lick it off all throughout the day, you're absorbing all those fats into it.

It'll get rid of wrinkles and everything.

I don't know if anybody remembers how wrinkled my mouse was getting about three years ago.

And I started using that about two years ago and I only do it when I do long engagements in speaking.

Just for those couple of times a week that I use them on that day, it starts replidizing all of my face and it'll help remove those wrinkles.

If I were more vain, I'd be doing it every day.

.

(25) Fatty Meat, Sheep
[2007],[Aajonus]

Oh

And the freezing does cause fat molecules to swell.

[Attendee]   The sheeps have this huge hail, which is all fat.

I'm just trying to go back and eat them.

[Aajonus]   Absolutely, absolutely.

Now, the lanolin in sheep fat is very heavy.

It's not like seal.

Seal is so rich that you can eat just a little bit of seal and be stuffed for the whole day.

You could get a third of that compared to what you could eat a beef, you get a third of a pound compared to a whole pound of beef and it's very filling and fulfilling.

So, sheep is the same way.

The meat itself isn't, but the fat is very rich and very concentrated.

.

(26) Filtered Water Isnt Good, Naturally Carbonated Canget Rid Of Stains
[2007],[Aajonus]

Gas isn't that important, it just helps generate more oxygen in the blood eventually, once turns into nitrogen in the intestines and carbon dioxide and that whole process

It is kind of a slight antiseptic because the carbon dioxide is a kind of a hydroegen peroxide.

It's like, if you get a stain, let's say you get something with blood on it and you just put the carbonated water on it.

Stains come right out.

It'll bleach your material if you don't wash it out with plain water.

So, if you get that carbon out, it won't have that type of reaction again.

So, it helps clear and clarify some things in the body.

That's the only water that I drink.

.

(27) Glands Or Cheese With Honey For Energy
[2007],[Aajonus]

Well, there are two things you could do

You can eat glands, eat glandular soups.

Like I said, that'll give you a lot of extra hormones so that the ones that you are using to deal with the toxins, and you can also eat more cheese.

Little cheese with honey twice a day, about 30, 35 minutes after your meat meal, nd that'll give you a lot more energy.

.

(28) Herbivores Can Eat Soy
[2007],[Attendee]

A soy fed animal

[Aajonus]   I wouldn't touch it.

Well, wait a minute.

Cows and, and herbivores can eat soy, raw soy.

It just doesn't taste very good.

The meat tastes like postage stamps.

It has this odd taste.

.

(29) Honey 90% Enzymes
(30) Honey Was Making Aajonus Tired
[2007],[Attendee]

How to get your milk not to look like yogurt

Did you add honey?

[Aajonus]   Well, this I didn't?

I got tired of having so much honey, and it started making me sleepy.

S,o it was time to get off the honey for a while.

So, it's been about two weeks where I hadn't had much honey with the milk.

I was doing it to gain more weight because I have extra cream with it.

[Attendee]   I drank some of your milk in the seminar and it tasted great.

The other pithcer of milk was sour.

[Aajonus]   Put the honey in as soon as it gets to room temperature or near room temperature.

[Attendee]   After five hours.

[Aajonus]   Sometimes it's as early as three hours?

[Attendee #2]   They helps preserve it too.

[Aajonus]   Yes, it does?

[Attendee]   How much honey would I put it.

[Aajonus]   Two tablespoons per quart, so I would've put four table screws in here?

I blenderize it, and poured back in the rest of it.

.

(31) Hot Tub
[2007],[Aajonus]

Now, in my hot tub that I have, that I built

I got a 300-pound Hayward sand filter, which is big enough to take care of a swimming pool, but I didn't want to clean and change the sand every year in my hot tub.

And I don't put any chemicals in it, so I have all this algae that grows on the concrete walls that I had built in this hot tub.

So, I like that algae.

Gets nice and thick and hairy, but the water stays crystal clear because of the sand filter.

Cleans every bit of everything out of it.

So, it cleans and filters very well, but it allows the algae to grow and it's an excellent filter.

It'll pull out almost anything.

.

(32) How Much Aajonus Pees
[2007],[Attendee]

In Iran when I was a kid, we were playing three hours of soccer every day in that hot sweat

[Aajonus]   Yeah, in Iran.

Very little water.

[Jim]   Do you still pee a lot or.

[Aajonus]   Well, I drink so much milk for the minerals hat I do pee probably about half of what I drink?

So, when I'm in Asia and I'm not drinking a lot of milk and I'm drinking the minimal amount of water, I'm peeing just a little bit.

.

(33) How Much Honey Is Too Much
(34) How Much Water Aajonus Drinks and Raw Milk In Asia
[2007],[Aajonus]

But I don't drink water, I probably had a half a cup of water in the last month

When I'm in Asia and can't get much milk, I will drink about two cups a day besides my juice.

I still will make juice in Asia, unless I'm in Singapore.

I get the raw milk from Australia, but it's called Cleopatra's Bath Milk.

That's how they sell it, as milk for bathing and not for drinking.

So, that's what I get there and different parts of Malaysia, Bali, I can get that there, but in Northern Asia and Lous, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, I can't get it there, unless I find a farmer.

.

(35) How To Prepare Organs
[2007],[Attendee]

How do you prepare your organs

Do you blenderize them?

[Aajonus]   I just go right into them?

[Attendee #2]   There's recipes in the recipe book.

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

I have some recipes in the recipe book how you can eat them.

I'm a very bland either.

My mother rarely ever used seasoning.

I was not developed with seasoning taste.

In fact, they usually made me ill and I can't take many seasoning.

So, I usually eat everything plain, even insects.

So, you're asking me about seasoning.

I used to be a gourmet chef.

[French] , which is a dish that you have to do all these many different steps and it takes the average person about 7 hours to make, I could do it in 5.

5 hours cause I was pretty fast with it, but you have to wait till it cooks and you have to cook it in different stages with different foods to make it really nice.

I mean, it was superb.

.

(36) Humans Used To Have Trichinosis
(37) Kefir Grains
[2007],[Aajonus]

How are you making your kefir

Grains?

[Attendee]   With the grains?

[Aajonus]   Oh, okay.

I don't recommend people use grains.

It's a way to do it.

The grains will pre-digest your milk, so that you will utilize more nutrients in of the fats, the proteins and the carbohydrates, but those bacteria compete with the bacteria in your intestines.

Prevent your own bacteria from growing properly, will even eat the bacteria in your intestines.

So, I recommend my recipe book, how to make your own kefir from the natural bacteria in the milk.

[Attendee]   I was thinking of giving it to my grandson that is one year old.

So, maybe not do it.

[Aajonus]   No.

Well, that would be okay.

Better than anything else he would get, but if you want to build his digestive system, digestive tract.

Then you would give him the stuff that you would make just by putting a little honey in it and letting it sit in the cupboard.

[Attendee]   He's having raw milk and the raw eggs from whole tube.

[Aajonus]   Oh, good.

Well, that's still better than any other garbage he'd be getting, so still a big step in the right direction.

.

(38) LA Water
[2007],[Aajonus],[unclear]

That water's already been used twice by industry in here in the valley

And then it goes, the third time is the LA area and Malibu's on the LA area branch.

So, it's the chemicals that are in the water from industry and everybody dumping their paint and chemicals and nail polished remover, and everything goes into our water system.

It's still in the water.

They take out all the germs, the bacteria, which I don't give a shit about.

The chemicals that they leave is the problem.

.

(39) Meat For Clarity, Milk With Eggs
[2007],[Attendee]

It keeps you very clear

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

It keeps you pretty clear.

Meat's a little bit more effective because in the milk you have a higher carbohydrate activity, but if you're using it with eggs, probably balances it cause most of the carbohydrate will go to digest the yolk in the milk.

But you won't gain weight on that diet.

[Attendee]   Uh, well, I'm not really trying to gain weight?

.

(40) Milk With Honey, Honey, How Muchmilk
[2007],[Richard]

I haven't totally got into your full, raw food diet yet, but I drink raw milk with honey, 3 – 5 times a day, 16 ounces

Is there any detrimental effect to that.

[Aajonus]   You mean as far as the amount of milk?

[Richard]   Milk and, or honey?

[Aajonus]   Yeah, should be fine for a while.

I mean, if you're on the diet for probably 4 or 5 years, then too much honey, you have to watch the amount of honey that you consume according to the amount of meat that you're eating because it can cause a protein deficiency.

But right nwo that's fine.

Well also, I drink one of these a day minimum.

Half a gallon of milk.

Even up to three quarts of milk.

.

(41) Organ Meats
[2007],[Aajonus],[Aajonus]

It all depends on what you have wrong in your body, what your body needs

If you know what organs and glands are weak, those are the ones you go for.

If you've got a severe protein deficiency, go for liver because the liver and the heart are the most concentrated in protein, the heart doesn't have all the bile and fat digesting, enzymes and activity that the liver does.

So, the liver helps you if you have a poor digestion of fats, you over metabolize fats because you're not digesting fats quickly enough, the liver is the thing they need.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   From what animal

Doesn't matter.

[Attendee]   Chicken?

[Aajonus]   Doesn't matter?

Any animal whatsoever.

It can be a gopher.

Greasy, greasy gopher guts.

[Fred]   But you said only eat organ meats from organic.

[Aajonus]   No?

I said glands from organic.

[Fred]   Is a liver not a gland.

[Aajonus]   No, it's an organ?

[Fred]   So, you could eat liver that's not organic then.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, I wouldn't.

But yeah, you could.

[Fred]   What about a soy fed animal.

[Aajonus]   I wouldn't?

.

(42) People Are Weak Now Fro Mvaccines, Get Fat
(43) Pills Are 99% Filler
[2007],[Aajonus]

They can only use so much medication before it creates a dangerous reaction, so they have all this other filler

This waste garbage product that goes in with, and maybe the chemical is 1% of the whole pill, then 99% of that pill is just garbage.

Toxins that you're just putting into the system and the coatings.

You know,how many dyes there are in that.

How many other chemicals just in your coatings?

It's embarrassing that some of our most educated, well-bred minds are complete idiots?

And I mean idiots that they just buy whatever they're told, it's a shame.

There's no science to it.

The information's given to them by the pharmaceutical industry, and they just regurgitate it to everybody.

.

(44) Powdered Whey
[2007],[Aajonus]

Bodybuilders eat the powdered whey, dehydrated

So they can pump and pump and pump and their muscles don't get sore, but it's chalk.

So, they have all this swollen fat that takes a lot of H20 to hydrate the tissues, so they're blown up with a lot of water.

It also looks good, but it isn't very strong.

[Attendee]   I cramp up when I'm being sexual.

[Aajonus]   You got a lot of urea, but see you had a lot of fat on you before and now you don't have that fat.

Your body got used to all that fat, could take all that urea, and had a place to go.

Now it doesn't have a place to go cause you're not very fat.

You don't have enough fat on you.

The more fat, the less cramping you have.

.

(45) Raw Honey, Frozen, Sugar Feedign
[2007],[Aajonus]

The only way to know that is to get my list, if you want to know those that are confirmed truly raw

[Attendee]   Is it okay to give him honey just from bees.

[Aajonus]   I mean, if you wanna know for sure you give him the honeycomb, then you know that it hasn't been heated because it's still in a comb and there's no heat to it?

It doesn't mean that they didn't use antibiotics on the hive or with the bees, and it doesn't mean they didn't use corn syrup to feed them in the winter.

So, you have to know that stuff too.

[Attendee #2]   And ask her if they froze it.

[Aajonus]   If it freezes, it crystallizes, but usually in those combs, they won't freeze it because that'll cause it to become brittle and then they'll break open and become a big mess.

So, they don't freeze.

Usually don't freeze comb honey.

[This is actually not true.

[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]   What about honey that is crystallized from the co-op, do I have to warm it up to a certain amount

No, but you better find out whether it's been frozen to cause it to crystallize.

Because freezing destroys a lot of enzymes in the honey.

It makes it more on the order of sugar.

And James doesn't carry everything that I agree with.

And he put that notice up there, took me two years to get him to put up that notice, but he finally put it up.

[Attendee]   Where is your listing.

[Aajonus]   The order form is in the back of the book?

Oh, it's also in the website.

[Attendee]   Are those eggs from whole foods really fertile.

[Aajonus]   Fertile just means that the roosters are running around getting laid right before the hens lay?

And that ensures that your chicken is not just in a small cage the size of its body as almost all the eggs that you get from a supermarket, regular supermarket.

.

(46) Reagan Ruined Unions, Banned Raw Milk
(47) Reverse Osmosis
[2007],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

What about reverse osmosis

Reverse osmosis doesn't take out chemicals only

It'll remove chlorine.

[Attendee #2]   Do you know what company has a three-tier system.

[Aajonus]   Well, the particular one that I suggest, nobody has it?

You have to take the three-tier system and make it your own.

You have to put the sand in the one.

Well, they do have the charcoal and they do have the paper filters, but the center one, and they have a reverse, they usually use the charcoal as the last, but the charcoals are first, the sand is the second.

[Attendee #2]   Can we request them to set it up for us.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, absolutely?

But they probably don't even have a sand filter, but you can ask.

[Attendee #2]   How do you get that.

[Aajonus]   Well, you just have to buy the sand and go to a nice beach and get it?

[Attendee #2]   And buy a filter yourself or.

[Aajonus]   Well, no, they have the three-tier system?

You pull their filter out of it and put your sand in it.

.

(48) Soy Fed Chicken
[2007],[Aajonus]

White

And it's also very toxic because humans and poultry cannot eat raw soy.

It has enzymes, which will kill us and kill them.

So, it has to be heat treated and chemically treated to feed.

So, if cows eat it, I'll eat it, but it won't be as tasty.

They feed it to birds.

I try to stay away from any poultry is fed more than 25% soy.

I won't eat it.

And if I had my druthers, I wouldn't eat any poultry or eggs that were made from soy or grown on soy.

[Attendee]   So, back to where he asked what from what animals do you recommend.

Like what farms or what kind of?

[Aajonus]   Well, I did most of my meats from the Amish, Amish farmers?

Who grow more naturally and aren't heavy into soy.

[Attendee #2]   About the question in Whole Food, when you buy a whole chicken, the organs come with it.

Can you eat it.

[Aajonus]   Well, they don't come with everything?

They come with a few things.

Come with the neck, gizzard, heart, and liver and that's it.

But you can eat those.

Like I say the Rocky feeds theirs 25% soy, so it's not best.

But the so-called Rosy organic, it's a lie.

[Attendee]   And now they're selling Mary, they running out of Rocky.

They say it's the same thing.

They almost don't have any Rocky.

[Fred]   There's only one Whole Foods I found that carries Rocky.

They've all given up Rocky, they all carry Mary's now.

[Aajonus]   I haven't talked with Mary's, so I don't know, but if Whole Foods is selling it, you know it's shit.

[Fred]   I did ask and they are feeding Mary's soy.

[Aajonus]   You have to find out how much, see when I called Rosy Organic, I said, “You're feeding them 75% soy.

” And I said, “Wait a minute, you can't feed soy raw to chickens.

You have to chemically, and heat treat it.

” “Yeah, but the soy was growing organically.

”  But I said, “Once you treat the soy and you're feeding them the chemical soy, it's no longer organic.

” “Well, the FDA lets us call it that.

” I said, “Well, let's talk about ethics here.

“ They had none.

They don't give a shit.

They're selling an item and if they can call it anything, they want to call it to make it sell, they will do it.

[Attendee]   Lily’s farm.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, they feed theirs some soy, about 20%, 25%?

[Attendee]   What chicken you eat.

[Aajonus]   I eat from a chicken farm that doesn't feed theirs any soy?

[Attendee]   Is it from James Stewart.

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

From James.

Either that or Rocky.

.

(49) Synthetic Vitamins
[2007],[Aajonus]

Those are chemically formulated, they're not natural, and they're never complete and correct

Riboflavin might have 42 components to make it up.

They may put third of that, two thirds of that component in there and call it riboflavin.

Did I mention the, what vitamin E is at the workshop.

99% of vitamin E is the byproduct of Fiji and Kodaks developing film and it is a highly toxic substance and they used to have to bury it in 12-foot-thick concrete tombs in the ground, in stainless steel barrels?

It's costing them hundreds of million dollars a year.

Because in Japan, they used to just dump it into the surrounding bays and water.

40 years ago, you could drop your film into the local bay and it would develop, it was that bad.

And the cancer rate started escalating very high, so they stopped it.

So, Kodak and Fuji were at an impasse there, so they had to start burying everything.

Well, Kodak's been that way for a long time.

And then one of their scientists, they kept hiring scientists to try to neutralize, clean up that chemical so that they could be recycled or at least led into the earth somewhere, so when it got into the water system, it wouldn't damage it.

They couldn't do it.

One of the scientists said, “You know, it's 72% like vitamin E let's call it vitamin E and get everybody to drink it, eat it, we’ll sell it as vitamin E”.

So, they called it alpha-tocopherol or just tocopherol and D-alpha- tocopherol is the true food vitamin E.

So, that's the way they put it.

So, FDA said, “Okay’”.

So, now 99% of the vitamin E, even the so-called natural in your vitamin stores, they'll put five international units of the natural, mostly from soy, which is toxic anyway.

Very toxic, cause the oils that are so poisonous to fowl, the poultry community and the human community is in the oil, the poisons.

So, they have to chemically alter that oil.

That's where the vitamin e is, so you got a chemical again in it, a solvent in it, and a neutralizer.

So, the 95 units that correct come directly from Fuji and Kodak are in there.

Plus these processed, so-called natural five international units.

That's what you're taking.

[unclear] , in Beverly Hills, the big one.

Dyan Cannon used to come in and buy two to three bottles of vitamin a week, and I tried to talk her out of it, but she was sold on it just made her skin very translucent and beautiful, but it also did that to her whole nervous system.

So, did anybody see her biography or movie of the week biography.

About 10 years ago, she became a complete basket case, all kinds of psychological problems, drug problems into there from that?

And her skin got so thin and she still couldn't stop herself from taking it.

That was after two years of taking it a tremendous amount every day, her skin, you could just take it like this and it would tear.

And she thought that she had some kind of disease.

And I said, it’s the vitamin E she could not believe that they would allow Kodak and Fuji to sell this chemical that was poisoning her.

You have to understand that a lot of people don't believe what industry will do to make a buck.

They don't care, what happens to you.

They really don't.

(50) Thin People Disolve Bone, Honey & Cheese
[2007],[Aajonus]

Anybody as thin as you are starts eating its own bone

It's a very fragile balance because the mineral level usually falls very low because of the fat, there's no reserve on your body.

So, any part of the day that your body gets mineral deficient, it goes for your own bone.

To start eating at your own bone.

That's why people that are very thin lose a lot of bone.

That’s why people who have cancer, the body needs a lot of minerals to bind with the solvent reaction from the cancer.

So, the bones just start eating away and deteriorating because the body needs all those minerals.

So, I think first you need to gain excess weight to have a reserve on, with that fat you reserve of minerals.

[Attendee]   From vegetables and vegetable juice.

[Aajonus]   No, from fats?

Butter, heese, butter, and cheese together is the quickest way to mineralize you.

Now him, he's already overweight.

I can tell him to eat cheese and honey together, and he will absorb all those minerals, but the honey and cheese have to be eaten together in the same mouth to digest the cheese.

In the human body the cheese will not digest, it'll act as a magnet and a sponge to hold onto the poison and pass it out of the body.

So, you have to eat honey and cheese together in the mouth to absorb those minerals.

[Attendee]   Okay, because I have eaten the raw cheese.

What you're saying is when I eat the raw cheese, I need to eat it with honey.

[Aajonus]   Two times a day?

Other times you want the cheese to pull the poisons out of your body.

So, it’ll free the minerals up in your food to balance and keep your bones and teeth and everything else together.

To make everything else work.

Cause we're so full of metal poisonings from pollution, from food, from water, from everything that a body is using a lot of the minerals to bind with toxins.

.

(51) Thirsty
[2007],[Attendee]

When you were on the subject of water that we brought, if you're thirsty, but you're not hungry

[Aajonus]   Again, what do you determine as thirst?

Your mouth is dry?

[Attendee]   Well, it's stomach?

It's not just mouth.

Yeah, my mouth's dry.

[Aajonus]   Then drink milk.

[Attendee]   But I get too fat.

I just put on fat and it just, even when I drink the kefir, and then I add weight and I feel sluggish.

I don't get energy.

So, could vegetable juice or certain types.

[Aajonus]   Vegetable juice will help, will make it better?

Just drink celery.

[Attendee #2]   Can you drink water when you're thirsty.

[Aajonus]   Well, I tell everybody to tomatoes, eat some tomato drink that you put a little lemon in, a little vinegar, some cream?

I’ve got one professional tennis player that I have her drinking cucumber juice, straight cucumber juice with a little bit of coconut cream and a little bit of dairy cream in it, and that hydrates her.

She only has a quart a day and she can play all day long on just a quart a day.

You see those other tennis players downing a gallon, gallon and a half a day.

So ,she only puts down a quart a day, and this is a woman who's six-foot-tall, Canadian tennis player.

So, she's really up there.

So, that's the kind of thing to do.

Look for other things other than water.

[Attendee]   Cucumbers.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

[Attendee #3]   I once asked you this question too, and ever since you gave me the answer, I've been doing it ever since.

I eat cucumbers and tomatoes.

[Aajonus]   There you go.

[Attendee #3]   I just came from the market, I bought 9 baskets of the organic tomatoes.

I carry them everywhere.

[Aajonus]   And that keeps you from drinking all that water.

[Attendee #3]   Yeah.

And I get bags of organic cucumbers and peel them.

It's great.

[Attendee #4]   Peel them.

[Attendee #3]   Peel the cucumbers?

[Aajonus]   Because if you're already taking that much cucumber in, you don't want all those peels.

They'll turn your digestive tract alkaline and you won't be able to digest your meats and your dairy as well.

[Attendee #2]   But for your vegetable juice, you don't have to do them.

[Aajonus]   No, because you're extracting the pulp?

Anybody who has really rich green bowel movements, you need to filter your juice.

[Attendee #2]   It shouldn’t be green.

[Aajonus]   Not unless you're throwing off some gangrenous tissue, but then it'll be a gray-green, not a bright green, a rich green?

That's too much cellulose from your vegetable juice.

[Attendee]   Do you have to peel the vegetables then for your green juice.

[Aajonus]   No, no, no?

You just have to filter your juice.

[Attendee]   Through like a coffee filter or something like that.

[Aajonus]   No, just take a screen, a very fine screen, just pour through the screen?

[Attendee]   Like Muslim cloth or something.

[Aajonus]   Muslim cloth is even better if you want to do that, it takes a lot of time to go?

(52) Tiredness From Healing, Detox, Vaccines
[2007],[Aajonus],[Fred]

It's better now, but for the past six months, especially last summer, I was going through like extreme tiredness last summer

I just worked 4 hours and spent the rest of the day in bed.

And then I got better and then I got a little cold and then I got worse again.

I kind of know I'm doing some sort of detox, but now finally I'm almost up to half normal.

I'm just kind of wondering at the lecture thing you said it was like healing.

[Aajonus]   Most of your tiredness, sleepiness comes from the healing stage.

90% of healing happens in the sleep state, unless you're a Yogi and can get into that sub alpha wave where you heal while you're awake.

I can do that.

So, I don’t have to sleep as much to heal.

However, when I get sleepy, I take full advantage of it, but I really don't get very sleepy, unless something's poisoning me and then I'll sleep more.

A lot of lethargy comes from your body using the hormones that you produce for physical energy on detoxifying, on binding with poisons.

Takes a lot of molecules of good nutrients to bind with just one toxic nutrient.

Take mercury for example, one molecule of mercury takes 200 white blood cells or 2000 fat cells to control one molecule of mercury.

It's a lot of nutrients to handle one molecule of mercury, and in vaccines, now you have 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury per vaccine, and there used to be 76 up until a year ago, 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury.

It only takes 200 to be antiseptic.

So, anything beyond 200 is absolute direct, purposeful poisoning.

The government is purposefully poisoning you.

If everybody were smart and intelligent and healthy as they were a hundred years ago, the government couldn't get away with what it's doing.

All these shenanigans.

So, they want everybody weak.

They want everybody toxic.

They want everybody having lots of babies.

They want everybody being in debt.

So, the two greatest things that they've created in this society to control people was credit.

.

(53) Tooth Being Abosrbed, Cheese & Honey
[2007],[Attendee]

My tooth here, it became loose for no reason last week, slightly loose and very uncomfortable, no hurting

What could cause that.

[Aajonus]   Either you have some mercury or some kind of toxin in the nerve, and it was dumping along the gum line and opened up all of the tissue or started melting the bone away temporarily?

Did you have any pain there.

[Attendee]   No?

[Aajonus]   Okay.

Your body was taking minerals out of your bone to deal with that toxicity that's in this area.

You just need to eat cheese and cheese with honey.

No, because he's absorbing his bone, but he had pain.

That would mean toxins coming out.

If he has no pain, that means when he's losing bone, that means his body's eating his minerals up where that nerve goes to deal with toxins.

.

(54) Water
[2007],[Aajonus]

He has no idea

He has no idea about testing.

He's just accepting other people who are selling the products, and I don't believe any of them.

Until I've tested something, I don't believe it because I've just seen too much biased way of thinking and not considering everything.

Water is a solvent.

The more things you put into it, the more damage it's going to do to your system.

How many people saw The Rabbit Proof fence here.

It's about the Australian kids, mainly girls who were part of Aboriginal and part British?

So, the British government comes and says we can't have our partially British girls living with their primitive mothers who are aboriginal.

So, they take the children away from their mothers and put 'em in these Catholic orphanages and they're brutal and mean, and you know, no love or anything.

And instead of with these wonderful loving Aboriginal mothers.

So, these three little girls run away.

The oldest one is something like 12, 13, something like that, and then they get younger all the way down to about the age of 8 or 7.

So, these three little girls run away, never drink a drop of water.

They hike 2100 miles through up to 140 degrees in the bush and they break off branches and let the vegetable juice drop into their mouth, or they dug up a roof and they rung the vegetable juice out of it.

They go through a whole day of hiking on four ounces of vegetable juices.

That's the way all animal bodies are made except for the camel and the elephant.

Those are the only two animals who are geared to hold water and utilize it properly.

Camel can hold 25 gallons of water and won't have to drink for 20 days, 25 days.

Elephant can hold up to 200 gallons of water and not have to drink for a month to 40 days.

Those animals are very different from human animals.

Human animals are not built to drink water.

Back in the 40s and 50s when I was a child, you didn't drink water.

If you went to the fountain, I didn't drink water, until I went to school, and then you just took three sips a day.

And then all of a sudden, the sixties come around, bottled water comes into fashion.

All of a sudden, eight glasses of water a day, eight glasses of water a day.

That was the programming.

The more of that you drink, the more soda pop you will drink, the more water you will drink, and it just dissolves the whole system.

It leaches.

Rain is water.

It comes in and it dissolves earth so that plants can eat, it dissolves rock.

So, when it comes into the body, it leeches all the good nutrients out of the intestines, your stomach walls, your mucus lining, everything, it dries out your system.

The cells can only absorb 10% of that water, and then that causes the same interaction, intracellularly.

Intercellular dehydration.

So, we're not meant to drink water.

[Attendee]   I have to say something about that.

One time, years ago, I thought water, aha.

Eureka.

I found it.

So, I was drinking eight ounces every 15 minutes for hours and hours during the day and was thirsty.

[Aajonus]   All the time.

When I lived outdoors on a bicycle, I drank two gallons a day.

And when I hit the desert, I nearly died.

I had to bicycle through Mohave desert, and it wasn't even summer cause it's illegal.

You cannot go through the Mohave desert, unless you sneak into it because they just block off old place and don't allow anybody in there, but residents who live there.

And I nearly died and I still had a gallon of water with me.

It wasn't enough, just kept going after because I was already dehydrated.

You have to be lipidated.

Fats need to be your body with lots of minerals to hold the fluids intact.

You shouldn't be transferring many fluids.

You look at the animals in the wild, they pee maybe an ounce at a time, a tablespoon at a time.

See the coyotes spit out a tablespoon of urine at a time.

Very little urine do they pass.

We stand there and we pee for how long.

30, 40 seconds, a minute, you know, and it's insane?

We're just wiping and washing out all these nutrients out of our body.

It's not natural.

[Attendee]   Us women can't relate to that little example you just gave.

[Aajonus]   Laughs okay, you sit, but it comes out very quickly like a horse.

[Attendee]   I can relate to that.

[Aajonus]   And you may pee a cup, two cups at a time.

That's a lot of fluid when we should be only putting out a teaspoon or a tablespoon at a time, every five hours.

.

(55) Whey, What To Have It With
[2007],[Attendee]

So, you said that you should be careful with it, but how careful should I be with it

How much should I?

[Aajonus]   Well, I think that anybody who has whey, especially more than twice a day, should have it with vegetable juice?

So, you have 4 - 8 ounces of vegetable juice, you have about three ounces of whey, and if you've got high toxicity, something like this, you might want to put a teaspoon of Terramin clay in it, and a teaspoon of chlorella.

[Attendee]   So, in other words, I could have a little bit of whey with almost a quarter vege juice.

[Aajonus]   Well, like I said, you could add 4 – 8 ounces of, of vegetable juice with3 ounces of whey?

[Attendee]   Together.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, together?

It’s because the whey is highly acidic with all the lactic acids in it.

[Attendee]   What is the benefit for it.

[Aajonus]   The whey helps get rid of urea, uric acid that builds up that causes muscle cramping also causes after exercising to get sore?

That’s urea, that's uric acid that builds up in the muscles, so whey helps get rid of that.

.

(56) Women Feel Sgood Drinking Water
[2007],[Aajonus]

Well, your blood may be getting so thick that it helps thin your blood so that things can work a little bit better

You may have a high sugar content in your blood, but it's not the best way to do it.

Best way to do it is do a good diet, but we're talking about optimal here, but yes, water works in that situation and everybody needs a little water, but not as much water as we're drinking.

And I stay away from water, unless I have to.

Unless I have nothing else.

If I don't have milk.

[Attendee],[unclear]   Do you know this water .

[Aajonus],[Attendee]   Yeah

Do you think it's good?

[Aajonus]   Again, it's a processed filtered water that's like the air, the Arrowhead water?

It's not really pure.
