(1) 9 Of 10 Ppl Penicilin Is Rampant
[2008],[Aajonus]

I see it in 9/10 people, and it's rampant

Penicillin is running rampant in the body.

.

(2) Aajonus Gave His Dad Raw Milk
[2008],[Aajonus]

Back in 1979, 1980, 1981, I got him to eat raw eggs with orange juice and eat olive oil and cheeses along with my mother

So, they did it for about 10 years and didn't do it since.

So, getting my father to do it was- cuz I just asked him, I said, I'm only going to ask you this once and I'm only gonna offer once.

Do you want me to help you.

I can give you some raw milk?

I can make you raw milkshakes, which will help.

When I went there, he was white, as white as her top there.

And he had four major sores that looked cancerous, but they weren't gonna treat him because he just had a stroke and they weren't gonna take a chance of him having another stroke.

So, they weren't gonna treat these cancer like abrasions on his face.

In four days of milkshake, his color was completely back and all four sores had completely cleared.

Not even scabs.

That's cuz he was raised on raw milk on a farm.

He reacts very well quickly to good foods.

[Attendee]

So, then that diet is great for a head trauma.

[Aajonus]

Lots of milkshakes and fish, but there was no way I was gonna get fish into him at that point, but I was able to get milkshakes into him and he drank every bit of it and he liked it?

.

(3) Agave
[2008],[Attendee]

Sugar issues

[Aajonus]

Unheated.

[Attendee]

Raw agave.

[Aajonus]

No, agave is not- it is a process?

[Attendee]

I've found someone and they are purely raw.

[Aajonus]

Not.

If they derive it themselves and they assure me of that with lawsuit damage and loss of their business, I'll go for it.

Otherwise it isn't.

It isn't stable.

Agaveis not stable.

.

(4) Bad Vs Good Meat, Costco Meat
[2008],[Aajonus]

You get the butter from a pasteurized butter

[Attendee]

Yes?

[Aajonus]

Well, it's like this.

If you buy Costco meats, let's say you're going to get a third of the nutrient value that you will from good organic grass fed beef.

So, you're eating a lot more.

You're spending just as much money.

So, I don't get the point.

[Attendee]

But Costco, they have organic meat.

[Aajonus]

Laughs If you believe Costco, more power to you.

I don't care what it says.

Don't believe everything you read.

Whole Foods all natural beef.

So, when I investigated what they fed their cows, I called their office in Texas and said, "What are you feeding your cows.

You say it's all natural?

What are you feeding them".

"Well, we're feeding them all grains in their grazing, stuff like that"?

And I said, "Okay, but what are you feeding them.

Are you feeding them GMO corn?

Are you feeding them soy?

What are you feeding them?

" "Well, we don't know that you have to go to the ranches"?

So, I went to the person who's in charge of getting all the ranchers together, organizing, have the contract for Whole Foods and they fed 15% bakery way, stale donuts.

Called all natural.

So, I called whole foods at main office, and I said, "You're saying all natural.

You can't say all natural.

You're feeding them stale donuts that are boiled in oil.

That is not natural for cows".

"But it's made out of their natural grain".

And that's their reasoning and their rationale.

Donuts are made out of natural grain and cows can eat grain.

That's their logic.

So, you have to understand, you wanna know whether it's really organic.

You go check?

You can't trust them.

You have to go to the source.

That doesn't mean they're organic.

Organic means they're fed only organic food that's never been processed.

.

(5) Bledn Cucumbers and Peel Them, Collagen
[2008],[Attendee]

You got the cucumber

Are you suggesting that instead of putting that through the juicer, we blend the cucumber.

[Aajonus]

You blend it, yeah?

What you do is take your cucumber, you peel it.

I don't care if it's organic, if you've grown it, don't peel it.

But a lot of people say, but all the nutrients are in the peel.

Yeah.

If you're a cow or a goat or a sheep, you'll be able to digest it.

Otherwise you won't, and you can juice the pulp all day and you're not gonna get much of anything out of that skin.

The FDA allows them to call organic cucumbers, that have been waxed with a bees wax that has 15% paraffin in it, and that's motor oil, and it's kerosene based.

So it's not a good healthy substance.

So, always peel your cucumbers unless you've grown them yourself.

And then what you do is you juice your other juice and then you peel and slice your cucumbers, put 'em in a jar with some of your vegetable juice, so there's not much air space in there and blend it, and there you have your vegetable juice with the collagen precursor in cucumber pulp.

.

(6) Brain Is A Garbage Dump
[2008],[Aajonus]

Most of your metallic minerals to transport light and conduct electricity

So, almost all the toxic minerals go to the brain.

We don't have big brains because we're smart.

We have big brains because it's a garbage dump for heavy metals.

The brain started getting larger the more we started using metals in industry for the wheel, for jewelry, stuff like that.

The brain got larger and larger.

The brain remained small as long as we were hunter gatherers.

And when we started smelting metals, we started entering a lot of toxicity into the system and the brain dumps out the sinuses in the mouth.

Lots of mucus necessary to do that, to protect those mucus membranes.

So if you got those good, thick honkies, more protection.

You swallow, you're entering those toxins into your system.

If you're a healthy individual and you just got some dust in there, you created a lot of mucus to wash the dust out, so it didn't get into the mucus membranes.

Swallowing it would be healthy, but most of the poisons leaving our brain are from canned foods, air pollution from your car exhaust and diesel fuel and stuff like that.

Not a good thing .

(7) Burtn Out Adrenals
(8) Butter and Dates For Thyroid
[2008],[Aajonus]

For thyroid eating cheese and dates together, I mean, butter and dates together are one of the best ways to stimulate the thyroid gland

Also, putting a hot water bottle at the side of your neck, or even two of them, and then taking a towel or silk shawl is a little bit more energetic and works a little better, and the only reason I believe in energies like that with different materials is because I've experimented with them.

And I found that it is a fact, wool even works very well, but I found that silk works better.

So, if you use like a silk shawl or scarf, and that covers the hot water bottle or the hot water bottles, intense the heat into the neck area.

It keeps the heat where you want it, and it'll increase circulation to the thyroid gland or any area where you want to heal the body, cleanse and heal the body cuz you have a particular problem there.

You put the hot water bottle there, add tent the heat into that area.

If you go to sleep with a hot water bottle under the covers, the whole bed's going to be heated.

So, it doesn't really focus on one area.

So, that's why you tent the heat into a particular area.

And stay away from pine nuts, pine nuts reduce the production of thyroxin.

.

(9) Ceviche, Lime Juice
(10) Chemical Sensitivity, Get Mucus
(11) Chemtrails
(12) Chicken Pox Is From Cereals and Grains
[2007],[Aajonus]

Well, usually chickenpox is a food detoxification that children get about the same age

It's usually from cereal.

Chickenpox very rarely existed before breads ever came into existence.

So, chickenpox is mainly caused by breads and processed grains.

It is a fungal type reaction in the body and it throws these poisons out to the skin, and because they're highly acidic with sugars, sugars that dissolve a lot of disaccharides and monosaccharides come out and they burn the skin as it comes out.

And that's why they pox, cause the scarring, the damage to the skin.

It'll happen in a whole group of children.

It doesn't happen one place, it'll happen over a whole city, two cities, three cities.

Any kind of a detox is always associated with humidity and temperature and the toxicity within the particular child.

Not everybody gets the chicken pox.

Everybody got chicken pox but me, but I got everything else.

And then when everybody else didn't have chicken pox I got the chicken pox all by myself.

.

(13) Chronic Overeating, Sugar Will Destroy Ecoli
[2007],[Aajonus]

It's never from that directly because the body is use to being in trauma, it has a higher nutritive need

Stress will burn up a lot of nutrients, especially B vitamins quickly.

Then your body's hungry for a lot of B vitamins.

Only way you can balance that is eating a lot of eggs and meat and milk and making sure your, your intestines work well, your E coli is plentiful.

If it isn't, you need to stay away from anything that will cause contamination in the bowel, and that's a lot of fruit.

Fruit will destroy the ability, ripe fruit will destroy the ability, sugars will destroy the coli, enemas, colonics will destroy it.

When the food moves from the ileocecal valve into the colon, the E coli they're plentiful, and they just keep eating away and eating away at the food, their discard, which is shit and urine, their discard is our food.

They've digested it for us.

They've separated and fractioned it for us.

So, that's where we derive all these nutrients, as it passes through, all that digestion is occurring, and then when we get to the descending colon and at the sigmoid colon finally is where all that stuff starts being absorbed.

So, the sigmoid colon, almost all of it is just ripped out of the fecal matter.

That's why you get very dry right there, and if you get very dry right there, that means your body is very hungry.

.

(14) Clay In Hot Bath
[2007],[Aajonus]

And of course he could eat the cheese to help draw out the toxicity from the anesthesia

Okay.

Do you have a question.

[Fred]

Yeah?

On using clay in the hot bath.

[Aajonus]

Who told you use clay in hot bath?

[Fred]

In your book?

If you like have a jacuzzi or hot tub, can you just keep recycling that same clay.

[Aajonus]

It'll it'll be forever good?

[Fred]

Forever.

[Aajonus]

Forever good?

As long as you had sand with it, and say you're using like a Hayward sand filter and you put clay in it, that clay will stay with the sand and they work together to filter, and it will never go bad.

Even if it goes to black soot, it still is good.

It may stink a little bit, like a sewer.

And if you don't like that stench, then you need to flush it.

[Fred]

Do you know of a good cheap source of clay for baths.

[Aajonus]

You can go to Terramin and get their crude stuff they use for fertilizer?

It's cheaper.

Buy it by the bags.

But make sure it isn't the stuff they put extra stuff in like bone calcium or something like that.

Bone meal, don't want that.

You just want the straight.

.

(15) Colonics Are Bad
[2007],[Aajonus]

Colonics are never good

They rub you of E coli and E coli is the final stage of digestion.

They are responsible for the final stage of digestion, the fats and the proteins to make them into that finite molecule to feed the brain and the nervous system and to release all the B vitamins from your protein.

Whether it's meat or dairy.

They are said to even manufacture in their excrement, which is called a verotoxin.

The medical profession, scientists of course come up with naming something as a toxin that they want you to be afraid of.

But the verotoxin according to the University of Toronto in association with the children's hospital of Toronto have found that the "verotoxin" from E coli completely dissolves human brain tumors in two to five days.

So, cancerous, malignant brain tumors in two to five days.

[Attendee]

Fasting.

[Aajonus]

Fasting's not good?

Like I said in my book, but let me finish with that.

.

(16) Cooked Meat and Dairy, Prostate Cancer
[2008],[Aajonus]

That's only if they're cooked or pasteurized

Cooked and pasteurized meat and dairy are a problem.

Absolutely.

[Kathy]

He was on the diet a number of years.

What's that.

Like 10 years?

[Aajonus]

He had filled his body with a lot of toxins and he wouldn't get fat, remember?

So, it's cooked meat and pasteurized dairy that are a problem with any cancer?

[Attendee]

The quality of the dairy and meat, right.

[Aajonus]

To an extent?

If you're having pasteurized, hormone treated dairy with no cream in it, you've got a real problem.

If it's skim milk, you've got a real problem because you got no fat to control that toxicity that's in that protein, in the chemically produced dairy.

.

(17) Detox and Dont Always Feel Wel On Diet
detox strict cooked food doctors mental function

(18) Dizzines Flu In Ear
[2008],[Aajonus]

He's having dizziness right now

Dizziness is always two things after a surgery: it's the lowering of blood sugar and the lowering of fat at the same time.

If you're dizzy, normally, you must be a female.

I'm glad I gotta laugh with that.

I thought, oh, I better not play with that, but I.

.

.

[joke]

No, when you're dizzy, otherwise it's usually an imbalance of fluid from one ear to the other.

That's what cause mainly causes vertigo.

You've got more fluid in one ear than the other.

So, to get rid of fluid in one ear to the other, you put a hot water bottle there at night tented around that area, so you perspire those fluids out that one a ear and that will lower it.

You can always tell which ear it is, cuz that'll allow more pressure on that ear.

[Attendee]

You put it in a towel.

[Aajonus]

Not in a towel.

You put the hot water bottle there and you tent, you put the towel over your head like this, so you're tenting the heat into the whatever side of the head.

[Attendee]

Is the bottle touching your skin or no.

[Aajonus]

You don't want it touching cause you put pressure against it and you can't make it very hot that way, and if you want it along many hours, Then you need the hot water bottle hotter, but it can't be too close to the body?

So, with his situation, give him some honey and butter is a good way because when honey's raw, it's only 10% sugar and it's 90% enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly proteins, secondarily fats.

So, the honey and butter mixture will help after a surgery that kind of dizziness, cause that doesn't have to do with a hemorrhage or an aneurysm or anything like that.

It's a nutrient deficiency.

And especially it happens from anesthesia, and a lot of people experience that.

.

(19) Doctors Giving Dad Glycerin
[2008],[Aajonus]

To say something, it was like he lost his thought and couldn't think of what to say or couldn't find the words, and it usually occurred after he drank something

So, after about a day and a half, I realized that every time he drank a fluid, it was a very thick stuff like aloe vera juice, but it was made with glycerin.

So, they put glycerin in everything, so he wouldn't choke on fluids.

So, apple juice with glycerin and everything had glycerin in it that he drank, and within 10 minutes of drinking it, he would go stupid.

So, I told the hospital, "Oh no, it's okay".

I said, "Listen, I am a biochemist, so I know what's happening.

Your doctors come in and prescribe and they don't stay 10 minutes with a patient.

They have no idea what's wrong with that patient.

They just look at their figures on a chart.

They don't know what's going on with the patient.

They've got these measurements that they look at, the blood test analysis, urine analysis, and they look at figures.

They're not looking at the patient.

That is not only ignorance, that is stupidity".

So, it took me a day and a half to get them to stop, and I was very nice about it.

I said, "Look, this is what's happening.

I think you should take him off of it".

By the evening, and they didn't stop.

I said, I know it is I've observed it.

So, you need to take him off of it.

The next day he was still having it.

I said, I'm not asking you anymore.

I'm demanding that you take him off of any kind of a fluid.

If he chokes a little bit, you just stop feeding him for a few minutes and let him get through, but don't feed him any of that stuff anymore, and I mean it.

Of course, that night they took him off of it.

The next day he had no dumbness.

He didn't go into that stuper.

We had a conversation the whole day, the whole day.

Thank God for the first time in 25 years, he agreed to drink raw milk.

.

(20) Doctors Put Iodine and Mercury On Skin, Heal Skin
(21) Does Aajonus Eat Cooked Grains
[2008],[Aajonus]

A cup of cooked rice with lots of butter and that'll alleviate a lot of that digestive juices that's looking for something to eat, I may have total of a cup a year, only in a situation like that

Otherwise, I don't touch it.

.

(22) Ecoli Causes 95% Of Depression
[2008],[Aajonus]

Digesting those finite molecules of fat and protein to feed the brain and the nervous system

So, you have to have a good clean environment.

And if you need to squirt some kefir up there that's naturally made, less honey for that environment, that's why I only use a quarter of teaspoon with the coconut cream, the butter and the dairy cream to insert it in there.

When you do that, that helps that E coli environment.

.

(23) Eggs Digest In 23 Minutes
[Aajonus]

Yeah, it will because remember, the egg digest in 23 minutes, 23 minutes, all that protein and, and fats are available instantly with very little digestion, very little digestive effort

[Attendee]

When is the egg out of the first stomach.

So, can I eat an egg 10 minutes before I do a workout?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, absolutely?

[Attendee]

10 minutes before.

It's got a first stomach that fast.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

It holds up in the duodenum a little bit longer cuz of the bile dumping in to use the egg yoke, but that's still not very long.

Probably five minutes, it's left the stomach.

It takes very little hydrochloric acid because all the egg white is already liquid.

[Attendee]

But can you take it 5 minutes before a strenuous hour long workout.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

But you're gonna get hungry.

You're gonna get hungry with only an egg.

[Attendee]

I get maybe a little tired, but I never experienced hunger.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Well, you've got enough weight on you, so that's good.

Probably okay.

.

(24) Enema Recipe
[2008],[Aajonus]

For the nutrient that the E coli has released to help balance that, you can take three tablespoons each of butter, cream, coconut cream, quarter teaspoon of honey, and put that in the 4-ounce jelly jar

You shake it, put it little hot water, get it up to about 100°, 102°.

Remember the cow heats up to 105°, cow's body temperature up to 105°, 101° - 105°.

So, you can take dairy up to that temperature.

When that little tiny bit of honey is mixed with that cream from the cow, it will not damage it.

Honey normally is damaged 93° on, and it turns it all back into sugar.

So, that much heat with that little bit of honey is not a contradiction with that cream.

So, you take an enema bulb syringe, like a four ounce one, eight ounce if that's all you have, a two ounce little baby one, but you have to do it in two stages if you do with the two ounce one.

And then right before you go to sleep, you get on all fours, you bark like a dog and then insert it in you.

And when you're doing it, don't get excited.

You provide this and then you insert it in you and then get down all fours, roll your stomach like a belly dancer, cuz you don't wanna remove it.

You want it to stay in you and then you just roll over on your left side, roll your stomach again and that'll move it in.

So, what will happen is it will lubricate the sigmoid colon and once it's finished lubricating that and the fecal matter, it'll go further up into the colon and feed the E.

coli.

I will help preserve the coli and make them stronger, so then you won't have constipation for four or five days and some people have to do that every four or five days, especially people with high anxiety stress.

Now, most people have that kinda stress any kind of abuse because.

.

.

.

(25) Everybody Has Cancer Cells
(26) Fat With Cheese For Constipation
[2008],[Attendee]

You wanted me to do the sugar cube size of raw cheese with either butter or coconut cream

[Aajonus]

Only if you were constipated.

[Attendee]

Yeah, I need something, either butter or coconut cream.

But what I found is, and it's been working out great.

I've had three big detoxes, worked out very well cause of all the chemical solvents, but the raw butter, for some reason swells up my front gum line.

I get an abscess.

When I eat the coconut cream with the cheese, I don't have an issue or problem.

Why is that.

[Aajonus]

Butter has a particular molecular structure that helps get rid of Novocain and Xylocaine, any kind of injected dental, chemical anesthetic?

[Attendee]

Should I be doing butter with the cheese versus coconut cream.

[Aajonus]

Well, I would a little of both, so you're not going to have such a heavy detox?

If you do the heavy detoxification, you'll even get numb sometimes.

[Attendee]

I can literally feel the toxin collecting it.

I mean, I can feel it.

[Aajonus]

It's all dental crap.

[Attendee]

Yeah.

I have a lot of dental.

[Attendee #2]

Is there a way to gently detox, I've just got tons of Novocain from dental work.

[Aajonus]

Oh, you're going to have a good time?

[Attendee #2]

What do you do.

[Aajonus]

You're gonna have good times?

You're gonna have abscesses and boils and everything coming out, unless you have another way to do it.

Your body may invent some way.

[Attendee]

So, using just coconut cream is not enough, I need for butter with it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

I would alternate, one time with butter, one time with coconut cream.

[Attendee]

Is one better than the other.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter?

The fat with the cheese is just to keep you from getting constipated.

I said, if you use three tablespoons each of coconut cream, butter and dairy cream and a quarter teaspoon of honey mix those together in four ounce jelly jar, immerse it in a bowl of hot water until it gets a little above body temperature, like 101 degrees, and then shake it up again, put it in a bulb syringe, and then insert it in you before you go to sleep, hold it, maintain it, and that will lubricate the whole sigmoid colon where most of the dryness of occurs.

Cause the body's soaking up all the E.

coli digested matter at that point, mainly your B vitamins and your proteins and fats digested to the right molecular structure at that point where 94% of constipation happens there for that reason.

And if you put those fats in there, it will lubricate and sigmoid colon and go up and feed the rest of the E.

coli and benefit them.

So, then you won't even have to worry about eating the butter or the coconut cream with the cheese.

.

(27) Fecal Matter Vs Suppostory, Pig Bowel Best
[2008],[Aajonus]

It is a good helpful thing

However, if you're eating the E coli from a Buffalo or a cow, it's a different E coli.

The E coli feeds on vegetation, even though by the time the vegetation is in the cow's colon, it's an entirely acidic environment, it's still slightly different.

If you get a pigs intestines and eat the bowel of a pig, that's perfect for us.

Our system is 86% like a pigs.

[Attendee]

When do you recommend eating feces.

[Aajonus]

Anytime you want?

I don't recommend eating feces that's already dried because the E.

coli's inactive.

And all of their little offspring won't become active easily.

I have some Amish farmers who will harvest it when they're butchering their pigs, and what they'll do is you say a pound, two pounds of it.

They'll tie it off, like it's a sausage, and then when you get it, you take just like a two ounce section, and eat that until it's gone and they usually will take care of you for at least a year, six months to a year, and then do it again if you still need help.

Or you can eat high meat, the bacteria in the meat predigests the fats and the proteins to be able to feed the brain and the nervous system.

Think about it this way, the high meat stinks like hell yeah, it'll stink up your house, the poop, you're eating over a short period of time and you don't have to have it all the time cuz remember the E coli from the poop is going to help your E coli thrive and live.

When you eat high meat, it does not help the E.

coli breed.

So, what you're doing is eating all the pre digested fats and proteins to feed your brain and nervous system.

It works because you get happy in 20 minutes, you can go from deep, dark depression to happiness in 20 minutes, just by feeding your nervous system.

So, remember, depression is always a lack of B vitamins and proteins and fats for the nervous system, E coli is responsible for making that grade of nutrient.

.

(28) Fibroids, Breakign Down Scar Tissue
[2008],[Attendee]

Information you have about fibroids, the cause and how to attack that

[Aajonus]

Fibroids are caused by a collection of dead cells or tumors?

It can be from something you're discharging.

Are you talking about vaginal fibroids.

You're discarding something through that tissue that's damaging cells in that area and the the dead cells don't get dissolved, so the dead cells are mummified and they retain in that area?

So, they're tumors, fibroids are tumors.

[Attendee]

But benign tumors.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

They're a collection of dead cells with no cancer cell.

[Attendee]

What do you suggest to remove that in the body.

[Aajonus]

Like I said in the book, anything to remove scar tissue: coconut oil, coconut cream, olive oil, flax oil?

Things like that.

[Attendee]

Internally.

[Aajonus]

Internally?

If you're eating a combination of like one tablespoon of flax oil or olive oil with some coconut cream, that's a better type of solvent to remove that.

Or you could have it with avocado, a tablespoon of flax oil or olive oil with avocado.

That's a fairly good cleanser.

Coconut cream is always your best, cuz the coconut cream, like the avocado, has water soluble fats and vitamins as well as the oil soluble.

In your olive oil and flax oil.

it's only your oil soluble fats and vitamin.

So, it's a very restricted solvent that can be produced for that.

[Attendee]

What about coconut oil.

[Aajonus]

Coconut oil, again, it doesn't have the water soluble fats and vitamins, and it isn't as caustic as the olive oil and flax oil?

So, it won't break down scar tissue as easily.

.

(29) Gluten
[2008],[Attendee]

Is that a myth about gluten and ligaments

[Aajonus]

Pardon?

[Attendee]

Like are gluten and ligament like efficiency or like how the ligaments spread out is that meant being associated with eating gluten?

[Aajonus]

Well, that depends on if the gluten is passing out in a way that will go to the joints, all depends upon the individual, but that can definitely be a problem?

[Attendee]

My girlfriend was, they gave her surgery cause of her knees and she swears it was because she had to much gluten nd it created something in her intestinal tract.

So, they did a poor surgery on her knees and it messed her up.

So, she's kind of had that same.

[Aajonus]

There's so many reasons for it.

There's so many reasons.

And of course, gluten can be part of the reason.

There's no isolated gluten anywhere.

In fact, if you're gonna eat grains once in a while, then bread, you're getting gluten in it.

Right.

You know, but I say tons of raw butter, or avocado or some raw fat with that bread.

[Attendee]

Millet, quinoa, anything like that.

[Aajonus]

I don't eat cooked grains, except when I'm in Asia and I don't have milk for a while or dairy products enough, like cream?

I take my butter with me, but I get very hungry.

So, the only way I can curb that constant craving to eat.

I mean, I can eat five, six pounds of meat a day and still be unsatisfied cuz I don't get cream and cream is very important for my body.

So, I will eat a about third a cup of rice.

.

.

.

(30) Having Trouble Eatign Every Few Hours, Lube Formula and Fishfor Meditative State
[2008],[Attendee]

I'm having a little trouble with the crossover of eating every three, four hours

Plus I'm doing yoga twice a day, straight for at least an hour, sometimes two.

And I'm not supposed to eat like three hours before yoga.

[Aajonus]

Who says.

That's if you're eating cooked foods, that's not if you're eatign raw foods?

[Attendee]

That's what I wanted to find out.

So, what's better.

Like an egg or an eight ounces of milk, 16 ounces of milk?

[Aajonus]

Depends on what you want to achieve in your yoga?

[Attendee]

It doesn't matter.

I just wanna have the food in me.

What I eat before, does it matter.

[Aajonus]

It depends on what you want to achieve?

Is it to create a better, more flexible body.

Or is it for meditation?

[Attendee]

A little bit of both?

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Then eat fish with something, eggs or some butter.

The lubrication formula and fish.

[Attendee]

Most of the time, it's like, I'm getting up and I've been sleeping for three hours or four hours and I'm afraid to have an egg or two, like I used to prioritize doing yoga because I might be getting up in another hour, doing my yoga.

So, then sometimes I'm done it with my yoga and I realize it's been six or seven hours since I eat something.

So, you're saying I can eat like an egg an hour before my yoga practice, 40 minutes before my yoga practice.

[Aajonus]

No, because remember the egg digests in 23 minutes, it only uses three inches on the intestines.

So, you're gonna be very hungry with just an egg.

[Attendee]

I'm thinking of like milk or an egg.

[Aajonus]

Have your milkshake, that's fine.

But if you really want a meditative state where you can transcend something, lubrication formula with fish.

it'll help flexibility, it'll help everything.

[Attendee]

And you're saying how much before I begin my practice.

[Aajonus]

40 minutes?

[Attendee]

40 minutes, it'll be completely digested.

[Aajonus]

Not completely, enough to keep you from getting hungry for two, three hours and do the job.

[Attendee]

Okay.

And same thing with a milkshake.

[Aajonus]

But it'll be out of the stomach?

That's the point, be outta the stomach and duodenum.

Duodenum is the second part of the stomach.

It'll be completely out of the stomach, including the duodenum within 40 minutes, that meal.

[Attendee]

Whether it is a whole milkshake or the lubrication.

[Aajonus]

With the fish, yes?

[Attendee]

Now, what if I just have the lubrification, mostly I'm having chicken around the house right now.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Then chicken and the lube formula.

That way you won't get hungry during your whole exercise, you'll be able to stay focused.

.

(31) Hemeroids
[2008],[Aajonus]

Hemorrhoids are a little different

Hemorrhoids is when blood is your decontaminator.

Your blood is acting as a filter like the lymph system, and it's binding with heavy metals and toxins that are in the bottom or rectal area, even in the prostate.

The blood is your cleanser.

That's that show a very advanced state of toxicity in the in the urinary and bowel area.

So, what happens.

You get a cyst that's full of blood?

That blood is highly contaminate.

When I've had the blood analyzed for toxicity.

Remember your doctors, and chemists will always look for bacteria.

They're always looking for the microbe, bad guy, the microbe villain, but it's always the concentration of toxin.

The six that I've examined the blood from those hemorrhoids, high mercury, high lead, high cadmium.

[Attendee]

High copper.

[Aajonus]

I haven't seen copper in a hemorrhoid?

I've only seen six of them, it's $2,300 to analyze one sample.

So, that's a lot of money ,I've spent over a million dollars and I'm finished with it.

Well, once in a while I'm too curious.

.

(32) Hormones, Tes, Estrogen, Adrenalie
[2008],[Aajonus]

Anxiety has nothing to do with that

Anxiety is having a lot of hormones for physical energy.

Let's say you have a lot of estrogen and a lot of testosterone, but no adrenaline.

The adrenaline is the most is the kicker to make you wanna be active in physical and exercise, but the testosterone and the estrogen are also physical orienteers, but they don't have the motivation type activity involved in it.

So, you can have a lot of testosterone, a lot of estrogen in your system, but not be motivated to do anything, yet you have to physically utilize that in physical activity, or you're going to go into anxiety.

So, you have to force yourself to exercise in that situation.

If you've got anxiety, exercise is your key, period.

Sure.

You can eat the nut formula to help to bind with some of that hormone, but usually you're producing it every day.

You can't eat the nut formula every day.

You shouldn't eat cooked starch every day to bind with it.

You need to fricking exercise.

[Attendee]

Is miso and salt the same thing.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Miso is like 30% salt.

Soy sauces, all of those are very concentrated in salt.

.

(33) Infertility
[2008],[Aajonus]

They won't reproduce and we've got that problem now

The rate of impotency is tremendous, tremendous among young people.

I went to Ohio to do a workshop last August after I left DC and I had three couples waiting for me there as soon as I got there to tell me that one couple had tried for 10 years to have a baby, another couple for 5 years and another couple, 5 years.

And they all knew each other.

And one went on the diet, got pregnant in 30 days on the diet.

The other one went into it when she found about it from her couple friends, they got pregnant within 30 days.

Third couple did too.

All three couples got pregnant with just 30 days on the diet.

They've been trying for years.

One of 'em spent $126,000 on fertility clinics.

And then all he needed was a good diet.

That simple.

.

(34) Is Chelation A Cure Or Heart Disease
[2008],[Aajonus]

That's the only one that has a lot of EDTA in it, natural EDTA

Not a synthetic.

[Attendee]

Do you think that the chelation is a cure for heart disease.

[Aajonus]

It is if it's a natural chelation?

Now, the first time I was introduced into chelation therapy was in 1970 and I was working at some health food store on Melrose Avenue.

The fellow started doing EDTA in an alternative environment and his skin turned tissue paper thin, and he was dead in a year and a half from doing that, cuz it just thinned the walls internally and external, and that's the problem with it.

Even vinegar will do that.

.

[Attendee]

Well, did he have heart disease.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, he had heart disease?

[Attendee]

But there are doctors that they do it intravenously in their office, and I know people that go two or three times a week.

Supposedly, this way they avoid a bypass.

[Aajonus]

They may avoid a bypass, but then they weaken the heart and the other tissues over the long run.

So, then what you have is bleeding.

Now I did an experiment this weekend just to see how sensitive I was with it, and I mixed a tablespoon of vinegar with a tablespoon of honey and some vegetable juice.

And I had that and I was in my hot tub last night and had a pretty nasty nose bleed.

Probably lost about three tablespoons of blood.

And I'm in that hot tub a lot in the winter if I'm home, not traveling and I've never had a nose bleed like that from being in a hot tub, but that's what vinegar can do very readily very quickly.

So, it was like 24 hours or 36 hours since I had the vinegar and the honey.

So, it works very rapidly.

The only reason I'm experimenting was cuz when I was in my early twenties, my carotid artery here was plaqued and it has the same plaque, it's never been removed.

So I thought that I'm healthy enough now to start ripping that apart, dissolving it.

I know it's worked with EDTA, the natural source is vinegar, so it does work.

You can tell using it on your teeth and heavy, heavy plaque.

You can put it on if you got a mineral build up from well water, put the vinegar on there, and it'll dissolve it readily.

If you put vinegar and honey on there, it'll dissolve it even into a little cream or almost make a cream substance out, less likely to drop off and crystallize.

That's why I suggest that if you're going to use vinegar, you put it with, coconut cream or vegetable juice that has some fats in it.

So, when it dissolves it it won't break off in chunks and cause an aneurysm in your brain or somewhere else.

.

(35) Killing Cancer Cells
[2008],[Attendee]

So, my question is mangosteen has been recommended as a tumor killer

What are your thoughts on that.

[Aajonus]

Remember that a cancer cell is going to die when it's time to die?

If you kill it early and you get rid of your cancer cells, what happens if you build a tumor with no cancer cells around to dissolve the dead cells.

It's my philosophy and my experience that you let the body dissolve the tumor when the body is ready?

As long as you're feeding it properly, the body's going to do it at the time it's supposed.

Remember, that fluid that's in a cancer cell is the same kind of property as a virus.

It is not alive, the fluid is not alive.

It's not a live serum like the blood, it is a solvent.

It is a protein structure that disassembles tissue.

So, it starts dissolving all the dead cells around and your body knows the timing, and if you do it too soon and you get some tumors later, where are your cancer cells gonna come from.

You have a limited number of cancer cells?

Everybody has cancer.

Everybody has cancer.

It's just that when you have a concentration of a certain number of cancer cells is when the pharmaceutical says industry says, "Okay, we've gotta treat you because now you've got a damaging cancer", and then they'll make $80,000 every treatment.

And that's what it's all about.

They want you to use their chemotherapy, their radiation machines.

Anything that makes them money, has nothing to do with fact and health.

[Attendee]

So, what about the mangosteen in general.

[Aajonus]

The mangosteen has the ability to be solvent reactive, but it just doesn't isolate it self to cancer cell?

So, if you have weak cells throughout the body and you start dissolving other weak cells, let's say it's in your brain.

You'll lose a lot of brain cells, you'll lose a lot of liver cells and that may be something you can't afford to do at any particular time.

.

(36) Lymphatic System, Cancer
[2008],[Attendee]

For someone who has lung tumor and inflammation in the lymphatic system, what would you recommend for the cleansing

[Aajonus]

Inflammation of the lymphatic system is the cleansing.

Remember your lymph system is the cleanser of the body.

It cleans out all debris, all waste, all dead cells.

It takes it into the system, either through the nodes or the glands.

That's where it does the work.

They'll set out serums like viruses, solvents to dissolve that tissue.

Then they also utilize nutrients from the lacteal system to neutralize those compounds.

Then it dumps it into connective system, then you perspire it out the skin, or it will dump it into the mucus membranes like in the intestinal tract to flush it out there.

But most of it goes out through the skin.

You take hot baths every day, 35, 40 minutes a day.

If you actually have lymphatic congestion, you look the book, We Want To Live under lymphatic congestion and do the lymphatic baths.

And that's doing one to two baths a week that lasts an hour to an hour and a half.

There's a pineapple formula in there that you take for that particular kind of bath.

Not for the short 35, 40 minute baths, but for the hour to an hour and a half bath, you need that pineapple, coconut formula in there to help move it.

So, your lymph system is doing its job, and remember your lymph system will contain more concentrations of cancer than anywhere else in the body.

If you plug one of your lymph glands and you're over the age of 38 years old, 80% of the time, you're gonna be diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and you don't have lymphatic cancer.

Your lymph glands are doing a job.

If you've got a lymph gland or node that is hard as rock, you've got cancer in that gland.

If it's as hard as rubber, it is not cancer.

If it's movable, it is not cancer.

It's doing its job.

It's dissolving cancer cells from somewhere else in the body and all these women get these lumpectomies and they're risking their lives because if they don't have the lymphs to break down all of that dead tissue in the cancer cells, they're gonna grow tumors like crazy.

So, all these women getting mastectomies and lumpectomies are just ensuring that they're gonna get cancer in their life and they're gonna die from it because they have no way of cleansing.

Hmm.

No lymph system.

[Attendee]

Can coffee enemas actually aggravate.

[Aajonus]

Oh, coffee enemas will cause cancer?

Three, four years, five years down the line, unless you keep doing them for the rest of your life, then you poison the body to the point where it says, Hey, screw it.

Then when you get old, you're gonna be one of those people that walks around with few cells alive because you contain all the dead cells in the body and they can't be dissolved out of the system.

So, it's all depends on what kind of a life you want.

So, you can make your choices.

So, you can do coffee enemas and end up an old person like that, a stiff robot with very little functionality at all.

Or you can not do them and let the lymph system eat properly, let the lymph system do its job, but anybody who has cancer needs to get very fat, that's very important to dissolve and feed that lymphatic system.

Yo not dissolve the lymphatic system, for the lymphatic system to get the fats that they need to dissolve the dead cells.

So, any patient of mine who has cancer, if they don't get fat, I know they're not going to last.

9/10 people who've died and only 5% die utilizing this diet with cancer, only 5% die.

9/10 of those would not gain the weight.

They'd stay thin like you, they didn't make it.

.

(37) Magnetic Touch, Aajonus Likes To Be Touched
[2008],[Attendee]

I'm looking at massage, but basically reflexology

I've read certain things that you said that I've also listened to.

I guess the last time you were talking about getting coconut oil massages massages that you're getting from people in Thailand.

[Aajonus]

I'm not into Thai massage.

I tell them how I want a massage done and it's always gentle.

[Attendee]

Right.

I got that from your report, for sure.

I know you don't want the lacerations or whatever, the excessive manipulation.

[Aajonus]

It causes terrible bruising, and damage in the body.

Just remember that a therapy called magnetic touch.

All they're doing is touching a few points at the same time.

They'll pick one particular point and they'll hit those points.

And I had them experiment with me for a three day period, cuz I couldn't believe the changes that were going on in the way it made me feel just by hitting those certain points.

It's called magnetic touch and their center is in Phoenix, Arizona, and they have a video you can watch.

That was probably the most effective that I've seen, but when I can get it, I like to be touched because I'm so mental.

Everything I do is in the mental plane.

I don't get to act anymore.

I don't get to paint anymore.

So, I like sensuality.

So, just for the sheer enjoyment of being touched, I like to be massaged very gently and lightly with coconut cream.

[Attendee]

But just as far as reflexology itself, that particular science.

[Aajonus]

Yes.

But reflexology is fine, but not the digging in the reflexology does.

[Attendee]

But then as far as just like the points themselves, they're fine.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, touch them?

Barely massage the area, that does all the electrical stimulation, brings the blood in, but let's say you have what they call a bone spur or a crystal in a particular area and you go in and break it.

You're going to be lacerating and cutting up tissue.

Just need some vinegar, vinegar in your feet, massaging in your feet with a little coconut cream.

Drink some vinegar, little small amounts to start breaking up those crystals, the way to do it.

[Attendee]

That would work for a cow as well.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, absolutely?

[Attendee #2]

What about Dosha massage.

[Aajonus]

I don't know Dosha?

[Attendee #2]

Where they go in and they start with their hands closed and they press, and they wait til your muscle relaxes.

[Aajonus]

It depends on how much pressure they put on, it could cut off circulation.

[Attendee #2]

You're barely being touched.

[Aajonus]

That's good.

Anything that's soft and light is nice.

Raw apple cider vinegar, yeah.

Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.

[Fred]

What about in reflexology a certain point in the foot equals a certain part in the body.

Do you think that's valid?

[Aajonus]

Well, you've got nerves running all through that can stimulate the nerves all the way through that point?

So, definitely.

.

(38) Meals Is From Processing Meats
[2008],[Aajonus]

Measles are a little bit more

Measles started coming in heavily, especially after processing toxic old meats.

Like from sausage, hot dogs, stuff like that.

That's mainly from that.

They used to use a citric acid, other times in history they use formaldehyde, and when you put that kind of substance, those kind of chemicals in luncheon meats, it'll cause a measles type detoxification eventually in your population.

Your kids are trying to detoxify before the they enter puberty, because if they go into puberty with those toxins in there they won't reproduce.

We've got that problem now, the rate of impotency is tremendous.

.

(39) Milkshakes and Aajons Look Sinny But Hes Not
[2008],[Aajonus]

Well, if you want some milkshake, but I want you eating eggs alone at night

[Attendee]

And milkshake would be.

Aajonus] Milkshake is milk,, honey and, eggs?

What I tell people to do, so they're not eating too much food or if they very skinny and they need to gain a lot of weight.

To me, skinny is my size, but I'm not really skinny.

I'm 21% body fat.

And let's see, he's probably 22% body fat.

He's only 1% more of than I.

Why don't I look it.

Why do I look like somebody, an athlete who has 10%?

Because fat molecules, when they are raw are very tiny Molecules that have been cooked swell 10 to 50 times their normal size?

I've been eating raw foods, no cooked fats since 1972.

So, all of the fat in my body, takes 40 years, all of the fat in my body is new raw molecules, tiny.

So, I'm fat, I just don't look it.

And that's the way you get to be if you go on this diet.

I've got women that have been on the diet 17, 18 years.

They're 27% body fat, but they're slender.

That's what all women dream of and you can have it on this diet.

You just have to be patient.

You know, it takes 12, 17 years.

You'll never looked fat again, but yet you have all the fat to be calm and happy.

.

(40) Mold On Concrete Or Wood Okay, How To Detox
[2007],[Aajonus]

Gangrene helps dissolve animal tissue

Yeasts helps dissolve the cells that have been damaged or highly built on sugar products.

So, those yeast eat those particular kinds of cells.

[Attendee]

What if you're a house has mold.

[Aajonus]

That's a dangerous mold?

Well, if it's in stone, if it's mold in stone and it's in natural wood, that's fine.

So, molds in a house, like black mold that grows in building material.

It is not natural.

That's very toxic to the system.

[Attendee]

And then what do you take to detox that.

[Aajonus]

It's not an easy one?

Berries, if you made a mixture of blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, even dark mulberries, a and coconut cream with lime juice and about 1/4 - 1/3 TSP of vinegar and that will help destroy molds.

Just remember, a natural antibacterial, antifungal shouldn't be used too often, but what you can use it to destroy even toxic molds that get into the body is lime juice.

Most of the time you get rid of toxic penicillin out of the body, cuz penicillin grows in the body and the penicillin is from grains and it belongs in the bird community, not the human community.

When they sterilize it for injection, it damages the RNA and DNA to have it go into hibernation as it's supposed to.

So, penicillin will always live in your body, always live actively.

So, the only way you can destroy it is by mixing a particular ratio of these ingredients, but it depends upon your body, weight and size.

If you're about 100 pounds, you could have 3 tablespoons, each of lime juice, coconut cream and honey, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.

If you are 150 pounds, could be 4 - 4.

5 tablespoons of coconut cream, lime juice and honey, and about 1.

5 teaspoons of lemon juice.

Anyway, you mix that together, blend it together and then you pour it into- depending upon your size.

If it's a small amount of a ratio of three of each, 3 tablespoons of each.

For 3 tablespoons, you use about 2 ounces of naturally sparkling mineral water.

if you're using 4.

5 tablespoons of each, you'd use 2.

5 - 3 ounces of naturally sparkling water.

You pour that ingredients into the water, not the water into the ingredients.

Chemically that's very important.

It will foam up like a float.

It's delicious, but do not suck it down.

Drink it slowly, otherwise it's gonna rush into the kidneys and the bladder, and you need it to permeate to the intestines and into the brain.

Most of it lives in the intestines and brain.

.

(41) Never Go To The Dentist
[2008],[Aajonus]

Some people build a lot of plaque

If you don't build a lot of plaque, you don't need vinegar very often.

[Attendee]

So, when should people go to the dentist for a cleaning then.

[Aajonus]

Never go to a dentist for a cleaning?

Not necessary if you use that formula.

[Attendee]

Can you do it with a water pick, you said a tooth brush before.

What about a water pick with that stuff?

[Aajonus]

Well, if you got the the clay up in there and you want to wash it out and you're afraid it's not coming out on its own, use a water pick to flush it out, but let it do its work for at least 12 hours?

Good clay.

You've got clay, the vinegar and the coconut cream together mixture.

Dip your toothbrush in there and just go to town.

As you're brushing, the clay will move up into the gum and then it carries with it the coconut cream and vinegar, which dissolves the plaque.

.

(42) Not Too Much Hoeny With Cheese
[2008],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question, Barbara

[Barbara]

Yes?

I'm pretty sure I missed something earlier when you said mineral supplement of cheese and honey, you don't want too much honey because, I missed that part of it.

[Aajonus]

Because it will cause a fractionation of the ionization groups.

Like you may have 5 molecules or 6 molecules of calcium with about 3 or 4 molecules of magnesium, 1 of phosphorus, 2 of potassium.

Now that's the normal collective unit that is a balance.

Too much honey causes a fractionation of that and they may not be utilized for feeding the cells properly, and when you put the cheese, that is used to nutrify the body, not to use as a detoxifier and not to cause mineral imbalances.

So, it has to be a small amount of honey.

.

(43) Olive Oil and Beets, Bone Marrow ,sperm
[2008],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question, Jim

[Jim]

For a month or so, everything's been blurry for this eye and I kind of worked at it by focusing at different distances, and that seems to improve a little bit?

In the book you talk about more olive oil and I think beets or something like that if I remember right.

[Aajonus]

Together?

[Jim]

Put it in the juice.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, maybe make your juice 10% beet juice and put about a teaspoon and a half of olive of oil in it?

[Jim]

Okay.

That won't have repercussions in any other way.

[Aajonus]

No, not at that concentration?

[Jim]

And is there anything that you put on the eyelid or anything like that.

[Aajonus]

You can put bone marrow, sperm?

Now, when you use sperm, because sperm are very, very strong- ovum, you can use ovum, but there's no way to harvest ovum.

And if you women got any ideas, let me know, cuz that's high in stem cells also, but the sperm will go right into the lid and cause burning in the eye, so you might wanna to let it dry a little bit and deaden and just a little, so the stem cells are active and not the sperm itself.

The bone narrow stinks a little bit, so you have stinky eye lids.

If you're making out with somebody, they have to smell.

[Jim]

Can't you just wash it off.

[Aajonus]

No, you don't wash it off?

Just leave it there.

I mean, it's just barely moisturized with it and you rub it in.

I'm not talking about putting sperm or bone marrow on your skin to the point where it gets dry and you see it.

It's gotta be so thin, barely wet it and put it in.

[Attendee]

What about butter.

[Aajonus]

Butter?

In my experiments with that over a 10 year period it caused a lot of burning in the eyes, constant burning all day long.

The butter's a very acidic fat and in the eyes it causes constant irritation.

So, butter's not that great.

[Attendee #2]

I put butter every day.

[Aajonus]

That's some people, depends upon their condition.

[Attendee]

There's butter in your face cream.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but that's mixed with other things.

.

(44) Only Go After Spinal, Esophaus and Lung Caner
[2008],[Aajonus]

So, I don't think that anybody should aggressively go after any kind of tumor, unless it's esophageal cancer or it's lung cancer or it's spinal cancer

[Attende And why is that.

[Aajonus]

Because when you have 'em on the spine, if you block the spinal cord, then you cut the connection off for the rest of the body?

If you don't mind being a paraplegic, that's fine, but if you don't want to be a paraplegic, it's like, okay, do I wanna live as a paraplegic or do I want to be aggressive and take a chance on dying sooner.

It's a gamble and on your case, I'd have to see your x-rays before I'd make that decision?

.

(45) Osteoporosis From Vinegar
[2008],[Attendee]

In terms of the osteoporosis and the vinegar, how how much should you be careful about ingesting before

Because I already have osteoporosis, because I've been doing the vinegar a lot of?

[Aajonus]

Well, it's not a good idea to have any more than, let's say a half a teaspoon of vinegar a day and have it in a vegetable juice.

It's a good carrier for it for the arteries and veins to break up the plaque.

If you put it in milk, not likely to get into the glands and organs, and if you have a build up there or you have kidney stones or bladder stones, then the vinegar and milk is a good vehicle that a good combination to get to the kidneys and bladder.

Of course, the vinegar carried in juice will get to the kidney and bladder too if you have stones to break them up.

If you have a stone like I had that grew since I was three years old, and that was concentrated from mercury from tetanus shots and other vaccines when I was an infant, it made a solid steel ball in the center of a stone that was this long, and this wide.

The longest one that all of these urologists had ever seen, of course it had grown for 54 years.

So, it was huge.

That's not going to dissolve with vinegar.

What the urologist said, he said, "I can dissolve that in 20 minutes".

It took him an hour and 40 minutes because it was solid metal inside, mainly mercury.

And I had to deal with those poisons that were dispersed throughout my body for a couple of years.

So, now if you have that kind of a stone, it's been a very long, long time developing and it's concentrated mercury, it's not likely that vinegar's going to work for that.

But your common stones that are formed from cooked foods that you've eaten, whether it's you ate the cooked foods.

40, 50, 60 years ago, when you're detoxifying and they collect and they bind together, they can actually grow like a normal crystal.

They can get larger and larger.

So, vinegar helps prevent that kind of thing, but no more than a half a teaspoon a day.

For some people who've been on a raw diet for a very long time, no more than a quarter or teaspoon a day.

Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.

.

(46) Parkinsons, White Meat With Lube Formula
[2008],[Aajonus]

Parkinson's is a disease of dryness of the nerves

It's like a mild version of Ms.

The lubrication formula is very important.

Lubrication formula, moisturizing formula; very important for resolving that.

Your white meats, remember white is a category, not a color.

So, any fish, any foul is good for that.

Eating it with moisturizing formula, lubrication, formula.

Also, yoga slowly done is important to help rebuild and prevent Parkinson's from.

.

.

well, the yoga and slowly done is to make sure that you're getting circulation and those areas are stretched to get into those nerves that are deeply rooted.

[Attendee]

Thai Chi also.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

That's fine.

[Attendee]

They've done some studies about how it helps to contain it.

Aajonus] Yeah, it will.

It's just getting circulation into those areas, but the dryness prevents it.

So, you can break up that dryness.

In a lubrication formula, you could add a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar to help dissolve any crystals that might be in those passages.

Because mineral build ups have some degree of influence in Parkinson's and, any kind of palsy.

.

(47) Pig Mesh Hernia Surgery
[2008],[Attendee]

Anyway, it's been seven days and he had anesthetic and a lot of antibiotics and all that

And last night he was so dizzy, he thought maybe he was having a blood clot and I was gonna go to the ER.

So, what can I give him to help the dizziness.

[Aajonus]

Well, the dizziness, her father just went through a hernia surgery, which means they put a mesh in there?

Now there are several meshes, most of them are plastic and there's one pig skin mesh made of pig skin, of course, like cat gut with certain kinds of thread for sutures that there's only a few doctors in the United States that use the pig mesh.

Cause you have to understand, doctors are taught to be afraid of any animal tissue.

It's the cause of all disease, animals are the cause of all disease on the planet.

Anything that's a live organism is the cause of all of our ills on earth.

It's absolute ridiculous, garbage, but they believe it because the pharmaceutical house tells them that that's the way it is and they totally buy it.

So, these are very smart people, but they're certainly not wise doctors.

These are people who are good parrots, smart parrots.

(48) Pineapple Only For Long Bath
[2008],[Fred]

Aajonus, quick clarification

Earlier you said you do the pineapple mixture only if you're doing the lymph or also for the regular baths.

[Aajonus]

No, only for the long lymphatic baths?

[Jim]

And that doesn't have honey in it.

[Aajonus]

It doesn't need it?

It's sweet already with the pineapple.

You don't need the honey, but it's okay.

You can use honey in that one if you want.

.

(49) Plaque On Bowel Is Imagination
[2008],[Aajonus]

This stuff about there's plaque on the entire bowel wall

I don't know where that imagination has come from.

It isn't like teeth get plaque, and that's how they describe it.

Cuz every autopsy I've ever done on an animal and those that I've seen on humans, none of 'em like that.

I mean, some of the intestinal walls are this thick in edema and toxicity, but there's no plaque, except in areas where there's severe scarring.

And then there will be some plaque on the scarring, but normally plaquing does not really occur.

That's a fictitious imagination of somebody who wants to scare the hell out of you.

.

(50) Restaurants Get Best Meat
[2008],[Aajonus]

Restaurants always get your best cuts and the best quality of meat

[Attendee]

They shop at Costco restaurant, most restaurants.

[Aajonus]

No, they don't.

It would cost too much money.

Some of your small family restaurants will buy from Costco, but not your good restaurants.

.

(51) Salt 2nd Worst Than Cooking
[2008],[Aajonus]

So, I've never had anybody that has not been satisfied unless they eat salt

Salt demineralizes, destroys intestinal bacteria, cause all kinds of problems.

Sure.

It'll get rid of symptoms galore, but it does it just like an antibiotic.

It is ruthless.

The second worst thing to cooking is salt.

[Attendee]

Not even sugar.

[Aajonus]

No, sugar's not as bad as salt?

In the intestinal tract, the sugar doesn't necessarily break down, destroy bacteria as is easily as salt does.

Because the salt dehydrates the bacteria, completely dries it up, sugar doesn't.

The bacteria can avoid contact and absorption of the sugars.

But the villi in the intestines, when the sugar hits it, it eats away at them.

So, of course, you've got 20 years of eating sugar, your villi are going to be reduced in size, dissolved.

Acidly dissolved from sugar products by a quarter every 20 years.

So, by the time you're 60 years old, you have very short Villa.

And what is the Villa for.

As the food passes through it registers what kind of food it is and what bacteria, and what digestive enzymes are necessary?

So, as the Villa are moved, they send serum out through the, through their pores, and that's your digestive juices.

In the stomach it's almost all hydrochloric acid, in the intestinal tract it's hydrochloric acid, it's numerous different types of even bile, but the most concentration of bile is in the duodenum.

However, bile is secreted throughout the small intestine.

in the bowel there's nothing secreted, except for E coli.

It's an E coli environment.

But E.

coli, isn't that the dangerous shit.

gasp ?

(52) Salt Water Flush and How To Rinse Your Nose
[2008],[Attendee]

You end up with more discharge, which is what you want

[Aajonus]

That's exactly what you want?

[Attendee #2]

What about salt water flushes for your nose.

[Aajonus]

Very bad?

Dries out and causes the loss of vitamin K and U, causes bleeding, nose bleeds.

Flushing your nose will cause nose bleeds, the salt.

[Attendee #2]

How about coconut cream.

[Aajonus]

Well, it's okay?

It's gonna burn a little bit.

[Attendee #2]

Is that good or bad.

[Aajonus]

The best thing to do is let some water sit until it gets green and algaes growing in the jar and then rinse with that kind of water?

[Attendee]

Say that again.

[Aajonus]

You let water sit in a jar until it starts turning algae, algaeic?

It could take months to do that, but if you got a jar of it, then you can just flush it sometimes.

[Attendee]

Like a pond in the backyard that's got algae in it.

[Aajonus]

There you go?

You can go snort that.

[Attendee #2]

Why do you do that.

[Aajonus]

The microbes in it, it's got sea monkeys, and they're very good for healing and sealing the mucus membranes?

The algae also will help break down and eat any toxic mineral in the water and break it down to a non-caustic substance.

[Attendee #2]

You didn't tell me that before.

[Aajonus]

You never told me you were snorting with salt water.

[Attendee #2]

But a doctor told me to.

[Aajonus]

If you wanna know about health, do you go to the guy flipping hamburgers at McDonald's and find out how you're rich or do you go to Donald Trump.

Do you wanna know something about health?

You don't go to a doctor?

They know nothing about health.

Doctors know disease and drugs.

Period.

That's all they know.

They know nothing about health.

They do not study health.

[Attendee]

You said it helps break down.

What was the word you said?

[Aajonus]

Any toxic minerals that are in the water?

They'll dry out the sinuses.

.

(53) Sinus Infection, More Mucus Good
[2008],[Attendee]

I wanted to ask about sinus infections cuz I've looked at the book and there's all kinds of stuff that I sort of flew together to try and deal with it, but it's from colds and this and that, and I wonder if there's anything specific that you have

[Aajonus]

Are you having a sinus infection or are you having a detox from the brain.

[Attendee]

Well, that's what I think it is?

[Aajonus]

If it's bleeding out the nose.

[Attendee]

Okay.

It's not bleeding.

[Aajonus]

No.

Then you're detoxing from the brain, and you need a lot of mucus, a lot of milkshakes.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Okay, which of course makes it worse because-

No, it doesn't make it worse.

If you're bleeding, you've gotta sinus infection.

.

[Attendee]

Oh, I see, but I mean, the milkshakes causes more mucus.

[Aajonus]

Now, it doesn't cause mucus, your body will build mucus with it, if it needs it.

I drink milkshakes all the time and I have very little mucus because I don't need it, but there are times when I need it, and then I drink the milkshakes when I need it,and it does build the mucus.

.

(54) Skin Cancer, Bone Marrow, Sperm
[2008],[Attendee]

Is there anything else you can recommend to treat skin cancer

[Aajonus]

Well, what I've been experimenting with over the last two years is using bone marrow, which has a lot of stem cells that helps regrow healthy tissue, but it won't grow cancer cells to allow dead cells to collect?

And remember, I said in my book, cancer's nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve dead cells and collects them in little stations, whether it's a wart, which is a benign tumor or a cancerous carcinoma of the skin where you've got cancer cells on there drawing more and more dead cells to the area.

Now a cancer cell is not a bad guy.

It's a very beneficial cell that draws lots of dead cells around it.

The cancer cell, when it dies, it sets out a serum.

It's like a virus, it's a solvent that dissolves all the dead cells that it's called out into that station.

So, that's why malignant tumors can dissolve in overnight or in days.

A benign tumor, there's no circulation to it.

There are no cancer cells in there that has that solvent virus type agent in it.

So, a benign tumor can take forever to dissolve and get rid of.

So, cancer is what I like.

So, cancer cells are good guys to get rid of it.

Also, sperm is a good way to get rid of it because it has a concentrated amount of stem cells.

So, putting sperm on any kind of a cancer or any kind of a sore.

I mean, I've got people using sperm to get rid of wrinkles and it gets rid of them very quickly.

Because what it does is it helps the healthy cells grow and allow the dead cells, which are just bricks in the wall to fall off.

I'm not vain enough to do it all the time, but I do it once in a while.

[Attendees],[Attendee]

Laughs

So, bone marrow is topical.

[Aajonus]

Topical, yes?

Well, you can use it internally too.

.

(55) Supplements
[2008],[Aajonus]

Yeah, he went for that treatment, but that's only because it was taking over his face again

But when I had that tissue analyzed, it was all concentrations of mineral supplements and vitamins.

I'm telling you, they're chemical, just like anything else.

The only place you can get food vitamins is from food.

Think about it people ,you have to use your head.

This is a money producing industry.

They want your money.

If they took vitamins from food, how many vitamin E are they going get out of a whole ear corn.

To fit a couple capsules?

Do you think they're gonna produce hundreds and thousands of acres of corn or soybeans to get a few vitamin E capsules, they would cost you thousands of dollars.

Each capsule could cost you $200, $300, $400.

These people are using chemistry.

Sure.

You've got a good guy with a good mind.

People who want good things, they go to a chemistry lab, say, this is what I want, and the chemistry lab tells them, "Oh, we can do that".

And they're lying through their teeth, you can't do it.

Cause that chemistry lab is gonna go to a food manufacturer and say, "I need your waste product, so I can use a chemical extraction and get a certain nutrient out of that food".

That food's already been chemically.

It's already been heat processed.

It's not food anymore, it's a chemical laboratory.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Fish oil!

Fish oil, still the FDA doesn't allow fish oil, unless it's treated.

Chemically or heat treated and both usually.

Can't do it.

You want fish oil, you eat fish, and then you utilize it better anyway.

If you're looking at supplements like butter X, that's different.

You got a fermentation process that cuts off this really refined fat from a cruder fat, that's like making butter from cream.

It is a process, but it's still a food.

[Attendee #2]

Is that the butter oil from the Western price foundation.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

.

(56) Synethic Vitamins
[2008],[Aajonus]

Almost all the foods out there in a grocery store have no nutrients in them

And when you see nutrients added to it, vitamins; remember those vitamins are not natural.

Those are all chemical.

So, you're really not getting any biological nutrient in there, complete form.

The food industry loves that because you eat all the time, you'll never be satisfied.

The only drawback to that is some people get nauseous from it because they don't digest properly, and a lot of the toxins causes them to lose their appetite, but most people are never satisfied, so they're constantly eating and they overeat.

The food companies love that.

Absolutely love it.

So, the more they can denature the food and make you eat more of it, they will do it.

So, when you're on a raw diet and you're getting plenty of the proper nutrients and a balanced diet like I organized it on page 40 and 41 of the recipe book.

If you follow that kind of pattern, for most people that will work and you'll never be hungry, you'll never have those cravings that are blown out after about the first 30 days.

Once your body gets enough nutrients, it will say, oh my God, finally, you know, I'm not hungry all the time.

I feel satisfied with my food.

.

(57) Tapeworms For Constipation
[2008],[Aajonus]

If you wanna resolve a problem, it's good to get a tapeworm or something like that

I had constipation from the age of 3 years old or probably 18 months after that tetanus shot that made me autistic, and up until almost 4 years ago, I did an experiment fermenting milk with some maca powder.

Which is a root from South America that has a lot of flavor and taste like Cheerios.

And I was gonna do it to help detoxify all the cereals that I lived on as a teenager and child and donuts.

So, I fermented it over a little bit longer than I should have.

It was so fermented than when I popped the top off the bottle, the alcohol actually burned my sinuses and my eyes were red and tearing for almost 24 hours, but I had 3 cups at a time which was stupid.

In a day I should have taken like 1/4 cup a day or something like that.

In 24 hour period, I did 3 cups.

So, if it caused me to have a tapeworm.

And the tapeworms do not live on intestinal tissue.

They eat the food, excess sugars, they eat sugars.

Only creatures in the world that get tapeworms are those that are fed cereals.

That's why all the African children that get tapeworms are because when they get the help packages.

These people who help feed these people are making deals with General Foods and Purina for the worst discarded cereals, so they can feed a lot of people and it's not about quality, it's about the amount that they can feed these people.

So, they give them powdered milk and we know by Pottenger's work with the powdered milk, it created the worst diseases and the most violence in the animals, in the cats.

So, they feed them this powdered milk with water in this cereal, this waste cereal that they can't even sell in this country.

So, they give it to these children and then they get tapeworms cuz the tapeworms eat excess sugar to keep the intestines from dissolving.

And we're told the tapeworm will eat all the protein.

No it doesn't eat the protein.

He eats only high carbohydrate foods that get into the intestinal tract.

So, I had this tapeworm going to town in me and I was so happy, my first parasite.

I've been trying to eat parasites for 36 years and I wasn't able to get a parasite.

So, this is my first parasite, because of chemotherapy and radiation I was too toxic to breed and maintain parasites in my body.

So, I got my first parasite, about 5, 6 days later, I get this craving for onion.

So, I sat down, who sits down and eats a half of an onion, just sits and eats it.

I can't even take much of onion in my food, but I sat down and ate a half an onion.

Within six hours, I shat out 48 feet of a tapeworm and I happened to be in a hotel in Hanoi and it was all hardwood floors.

I was paying $12 for a hotel room that was all wood, all wood furniture.

Excellent quality, $12.

The ceiling was wood Parque and floor was real teak wood Parque, $12 a night.

So, I had to get this thing out of the toilet cause I wanted to measure it, see how long it was.

A tapeworm's sections will shrivel up like a rice in about six hours, a tapeworm noodle will just look like a rice.

Harvested dry, hard rice.

So, I had to get it spread out quickly to measure it.

So, I'm putting it gently along the floor.

It took me about probably 20 minutes, so I knew it shrunk a few feet at that point, but I had about 47 feet of tapeworm, which probably about 50 feet.

So, I was all upset with myself because it came out with the onion, just shot out with the onion.

So, I was all upset and then about eight weeks later and I had diarrhea, not a lot of diarrhea, but when I had the movement every day, it was diarrhea.

So, it wasn't annoying.

I didn't have to run to a toilet all the time, when I had it once a day, it was diarrhea.

I guess it was about six weeks later, I noticed a noodle in the toilet again, and it's floating like a stingray, and that's again, a section of a tapeworm.

So, I thought, oh my God, you see, he lives, he lives in me, doing work.

And then I had him for about six weeks.

I'd see segments every time I had a bowel movement, I've never been constipated since.

Even on a raw diet, I was constipated with the first part of the fecal matter.

When I was a child, I went every three to five days.

So, when it came out, it came out as big as my fist and as hard as granite and felt like granite, was just sharp and it ripped my rectum.

So, by the time I was 21 years old, 22 went onto the raw diet.

My rectum was an inch thick with fibroids, scar tissue, from ripping.

And it would rip, I bled every time I went to the bathroom, every time I had a bowel movement and it continued on this diet.

I could have 5, 6 bowel movements a day, but the first one in the day, the first part of it was hard as granite again, always.

When I had that tapeworm, ever since the tapeworm, everything is smooth.

.

(58) Teeth Throbbing and Sensitive and Root Canal
[2008],[Attendee]

Regarding of some teeth of mine

[Aajonus]

That's trying to clean out the circulation.

[Attendee]

And when I brush the sides of the teeth it's sensitive, and I really don't want to go for cleaning.

I dread it.

[Aajonus]

Don't.

Just use the vinegar, the coconut cream and clay, and that'll clean them.

Also, eat cheese regularly, every hour, little piece of cheese.

That will make sure that you're using the minerals from the cheese to bind with the poison, and you're not using the minerals in the food.

[Attendee]

So, should I wait to go to the dentist for the cleaning because.

[Aajonus]

Oh, I wouldn't go for a cleaning?

You just use your vinegar.

[Attendee]

Well, every six months I go for a cleaning.

[Aajonus]

Not necessary if you're using the vinegar, clay and coconut cream.

It gets a deep down in.

Like I said, the clay carries the coconut cream and the vinegar deep into the gums and it dissolves the plaque, so you don't have to have some metal instrument going there and cutting and ripping your gums apart.

[Attendee]

How often to do that.

[Aajonus]

Do it every day if you want?

[Attendee]

Instead of toothpaste.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that is toothpaste?

.

(59) Tetracycline, Biopics Teeth Wont Whiten
[2008],[Aajonus]

Anybody who's had heavy tetracycline or alike antibiotics, and wants to have their teeth whitened, you can forget it about it because the molds grow into the nerve and it's outward, that's what these teeth

These are tetracycline damaged and they're too small to have them capped, so I'll just have to live with my dark teeth.

There's no way cuz it's in the nerve and the nerves dump the toxins.

Cuz molds eat metals, so they break them down into a finer substance, a finer molecule, so when it leaves the nerves and gets into the tubules and the tubules feed the dentine, it turns the whole tooth colored.

.

(60) Thalium
[2008],[Aajonus]

But she never gained as much weight, she was still 10 pounds under

I wanted her to gain 10 more pounds and she wouldn't do it.

And this girl, Kimberly at the end, she was vomiting like crazy, like said not as bad as Owanza, but you know, 7 times a day, 8 times a day, and after two and a half months, I had to figure out what she was vomiting.

So, I took 4-ounces of her vomit and sent it to a laboratory, and the laboratory called me and said, "Somebody's poisoning your patient".

And I said, "What do you mean".

He said, "She has 3000 times the lethal dose of thallium in that four ounces of vomit"?

And I said, "Nobody's poisoning her.

She was a metal jeweler She made silver jewelry, and burned it right over the Bunsen burner, never wore a mask or gloves, so she inhaled all that thallium.

Thallium is a mineral that's almost as toxic as mercury and almost as soft as lead, and it's highly toxic.

Not quite as bad as mercury, but nearly.

So, she was just at the end, the tumors stopped forming, everything.

She didn't have enough weight, she couldn't eat for the last two and a half weeks.

She died because she couldn't eat.

If she had just had 10 more fricking pounds, like I tried to get her to do for two years, she would've made it through that crisis.

And that's why I say, if you got a serious problem, you need to be overweight because when you go through that detoxification process, if it's an intense one, you are not likely to make it.

.

(61) Tiredness Is From Losing Nutrietns and Longer Awake More You Detox
[2008],[Aajonus]

Anytime you get tired, the body's losing its nutrients on activity, on lactic acid and stuff like that

It's time to take a nap, and just reduce.

[Attendee]

I feel it on those two teeth.

[Aajonus]

Well, you've got toxicity there, so that's part of cleansing.

Just remember the more you stay awake, the more you're gonna detoxify.

90% of healing happens in the sleep state.

So, if you're not sleeping, you're not healing.

You're gonna be detoxing constantly.

[Attendee]

On this diet.

[Aajonus]

Any diet?

[Attendee #2]

So, what is it when your gums bleed.

What is that?

Is that the same?

[Aajonus]

That's the heavy metals passing down and preventing blood clotting using up the K and U?

So you can eat some green cabbage juice.

That'll give you enough vitamin K to clot, but that's heavy metals leaving the brain: mercury, lead Thallium from the brain, even aluminum prevents healing.

So, it causes bleeding.

.

(62) Tomatoes To Detox Prostate
[2008],[Attendee]

How do you detox the prostate

[Aajonus]

Well, tomatoes are an excellent way to detox the prostate?

[Attendee]

Isn't at the lowest point in a man's body, so a lot of stuff collects down there.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely, it's a muscle?

It's a muscle with a very low fat level.

It's got the concentration of protein that the heart does because it's like a heart.

The object of the prostate gland is to eject the sperm.

That's the only job of the prostate, it's to eject sperm.

[Attendee #2]

What is this high PSA.

[Aajonus]

PSA is garbage regulation?

It's another measurement where the pharmaceutical industry says, "Okay, doctors, if you got a PSA count, treat these people for prostate cancer".

If PSA had anything to do with prostate cancer.

When you have a prostate removed, the PSA count should disappear, and my patients have come to me with prostate cancer and then had the prostates removed.

I've seen the PSA up to 86 and then they had prostate.

Why do they have a PSA count.

Doctors say, "Oh, well, they start producing in other areas of the body"?

That's absolutely bullshit.

Again, it's the pharmaceutical industry making a fortune because all men will have prostate problems on a bad diet sometime later in their life.

[Attendee #3]

Why does that push it.

[Aajonus]

The PSA has nothing to do with prostate health, nothing to do with prostate health?

[Attendee]

You're right.

I worked on that.

[Aajonus]

You worked on that test.

[Attendee]

Yes?

I worked on that test and Jim Marco developed it.

It's all market.

I was working there two years to sell it to the industry that that was a marker.

[Aajonus]

This is a biochemist.

[Attendee]

No, I'm a medical engineer.

[Aajonus]

Medical engineer.

Well, you know, medical engineer who knows biochemistry.

So, he worked on that test for PSA, it is garbage science.

Again, the pharmaceutical industry to get every male and one out of three males has prostate problems in their lifetime.

And look at the therapy.

How much does it cost.

You gotta go through prostate removal, if you're getting radiation therapy or chemotherapy for prostate cancer, hundreds of thousands of dollars?

It's a big money issue again, it's marketing, just like you said, it's marketing.

You eat tomatoes.

Tomatoes are great for getting rid of prostate cancer.

[Attendee]

But it has to be strained the way you say in the book.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't have to be strained?

Usually people who have a prostate problem have polyps in the bowels.

I find that they you go hand in hand about 80% of the time, and sometimes those seeds in the tomato could cause some polyps problems.

[Attendee]

So it's good to filter those out.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Filter or juice it.

Blueberries, and coconut cream are great for prostate.

[Attendee]

Together.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, together?

[Attendee #3]

Prostate gland produces seminal fluid for the sperm to slide on, not producing the sperm.

[Aajonus]

No, it's a muscle.

It's not a gland.

Really.

They call it prostate gland and it does have fluid, but it isn't like the bursas, which create a fluid to keep lubrication in there.

It's mainly a muscle.

There are areas where it creates that fluid, but it's mainly a fluid for itself.

Like fat deposits on the top of a heart, that creates a fluid too.

So, that part of the heart can be called a gland because it creates a fluid, which is like bursa fluid, which lubricates the muscles and keeps them from going into lockdown or charlie horse.

.

(63) Urinary Tract Infection
[2008],[Attendee]

What is a urinary track infection

[Aajonus]

Anywhere are damaged cells, either damaged from the chemicals that you're eating or in your environment?

So, if they're in the urethra or in the kidney or in the bladder, you've got a urinary tract infection.

If those cells are damaged, your body will use either bacteria, parasites, or fungus if you're lucky.

If you're unlucky and they're so toxic that the fungus, the bacteria, or the parasites can't eat it, then you have to use a viral infection to clean it.

So, it's always a cleansing.

When you stop doing the things that irritate and damage the urinary tract, you'll stop having infections.

Of course, a lot of poisons get dumped into the urinary tract, so those can cause damage if you don't have a good enough fat in those cells in the walls of your urethrae, kidneys and bladder are not solid and protected, they can be damaged.

[Attendee]

So, I started changing my diet, and I noticed that I started getting urinary infections, but I changed my diet to eating more fat, raw fats, I wouldn't have created that infection.

[Aajonus]

No, that won't have created, your body will have you say, "Oh, I've got the fats now, let's get rid of this garbage"?

And then all of a sudden you've got this stuff leaving to urinary tract and you've got dead cells leaving, they have to get dissolved and separated from the tissue there.

They don't just fall off on their own.

So, it's gotta go in there.

[Attendee]

I've never got a urinary tract infection my life.

This is the first time.

[Aajonus]

Congratulations.

[Attendee]

I didn't know what it was.

[Aajonus]

It's a cleansing, but you're still pretty thin.

I don't know how much fat are in your urinary tract walls.

It's a difficult place to feed.

So, anybody who has a urinary tract infection, skin problems, you have to eat the moisturizing, lubrication formula.

I love telling this story.

It's two names because women love moisturizing, men love lubrication.

So, I call it two things.

.

(64) Used To Be Vegan Water Weight
[2008],[Attendee]

I've only been following this- I used to be vegan before, and I just found myself getting unhealthy

I went raw vegan for awhile and got more unhealthy, and then that's how I got here.

So, I've been doing this diet for maybe three months and I noticed that I have gotten kind of puffy, just kind of rounded out, and I actually still have the same % body fat.

I've actually gained like a lot of.

weight, even though my body fat's not really going up that much, maybe 1%.

They're very dense, but puffy at the same time.

[Aajonus]

If you are only 12% body fat, probably 40% of your excess weight is water.

So, you don't have a fat problem.

If you're 12%, you've got a fat deficiency problem.

You've got a water retention problem.

You need to stay away from water like the plague.

[Attendee]

Really.

Cause I did that when I first read your book, but I noticed I was so thirsty all the time and I'm scared to drink so much milk cause I'd get really fat?

[Aajonus]

Well, you sip it.

See the problem is everybody gulps.

You see me when I'm taking it, you don't see me going glug, glug, glug.

You see me keeping my lips together and drawing out like I'm suckling a nipple and draw the milk through.

So, I drink very little milk compared to somebody who gulps it and glugs it.

It makes a difference in how you utilize it, and you will bloat because your body needs that milk to help go in there and change the circumstance if you were vegetarian.

.

(65) Vegetable Oisl Crystalize
[2008],[Aajonus]

You are very fat deficient because vegetable oils crystallize in the human body, they dehydrate in the human body

They do not stay fluid at the human body temperature.

Herbivores have a body temperature 101° - 105°.

Vegetable oils remain solvent and soluble at those temperatures, but in 98.

6° and lower it does not.

It crystalizes and hardens.

So, you've got a lot of crystallized fat in your body from being a vegetarian.

Probably a lot of it was cooked, even worse.

So, you're gonna have a lot of bloating for a long time.

Your body just has to rebuild itself completely, has to completely remodel itself.

[Attendee]

So, you can do the diet and over time it will basically.

[Aajonus]

Uhuh?

[Attendee]

There's nothing in particular you recommend eating that will help the process.

[Aajonus]

Uhuh?

It's just time.

That's all you do is wait for your body to do it.

It's like, you want to build a mansion.

You gonna do it overnight?

No.

It's stages with a lot of help and a lot of processes.

.

(66) Vegetables Are Bad To Eat
[2008],[Attendee]

What about putting a vinegar on your salad

[Aajonus]

Well, you can do that, but I don't eat salads?

My vegetable juice is my salad.

Just remember when you eat a salad, it's a whole celluloses.

We don't have the digestive tract to break that down, so as the cellulose is passing through the digestive tract is going to be constantly secreting alkaline fluids.

What is the environment for our intestines.

It's an acid bacteria and acid enzyme environment and digestive juices?

So, if you neutralize that you're not gonna digest your milk or your meats, and your eggs and that's basically the diet.

So, whole vegetables is not a good thing to eat.

Cucumber is different.

It's not a vegetable, it's a bland fruit, and that cellulose in a cucumber is very different.

There's a lot of collagen precursors in it.

So, it will help the skin, it will make your skin a lot better, it'll help hydrate it properly, keep it soft and smooth and healthy.

So, what you can do if you have cucumber in your juice, you can blend into a puree, some of that cucumber, and then mix it with the rest of your vegetable juice, the vegetables that you do juice, you separate the pulp from the juice.

[Attendee]

What do you think of salads.

[Aajonus]

That's a terrible thing?

The cellulous molecule has to be broken down infinitely, and it can only, it can do that in a herbivores stomach, a ruminant animal, it takes 48 hours.

Our food passes through in 24 hours.

They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule.

Plus they chew, they swallow, they regurgitate, chew, swallow.

And I don't see anybody here doing that, having a bowel movement with the same food that they ate 48 hours later is 24 hours later.

So again, what it does is it will cause all that alkalinity because you've got the pulp.

If you want example of that, even the good juicers like, a green star juicer or any of the green gold juicers.

That removes a lot of pulp.

And if you don't filter it, you're going to get still a lot of pulp in there, and if your bowel movement is green, that tells you how much cell is still passing through, and you may need to filter it some more if you're not digesting your meats and your dairy properly.

So, you may need to filter your vegetable juice further and get as much pulp out of as you can.

Some people who have a very, very dark toxic intestinal tract can use that little bit of pulp, but preferable pulp would be coconut fiber pulp.

So, when you juice the coconut you don't strain the coconut cream and there's always a little pulp in it.

And I've asked James not to filter that at Rawsome, so that we do get some of that fiber and it helps clean the intestinal tract of that toxicity that is severely embedded in the intestinal walls.

.

(67) Water Ph
[2008],[Lewis]

I'm told that the ideal pH for water is 7

3, favoring alkalinity, and there's at least one machine out there that not only filters out the chemicals, but it keeps it at this ideal alkalinity and with all the bottles that he's tested, they don't meet his criteria for the ideal alkalinity.

So, the quick question is, is a good glass bottle of water preferable to any of the filtration machines out there.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

What water do you know that animals drink that's alkaline.

Animals drink out of ponds with heavy algae, all of it's acidic?

If you have an alkaline environment, you're not gonna have any living thing in it, not many living things in it.

[Lewis]

So, the quick answer is the natural waters that we get, they're not supposed to have that high of pH.

[Aajonus]

Exactly?

You have your vegetable juices, which carries other vitamin and enzymes with those alkalizing substances, so they don't do damage.

Not supposed to be drinking very much water anyway.

.

(68) Weight Loss
[2008],[Attendee]

Detoxification cycles of weight gain and weight loss, and I noticed for me the weight gain cycle's no problem, but the weight loss portion, change between the green juice and the meats meat and just back and forth, and then at the end of the day before you go to sleep you can have some milkshake or something

But I find that I just don't feel satiated from that combination.

It is very hard to lose the weight like that.

[Aajonus]

Not supposed feel satiated.

You're supposed to be hungry all the time, but the only reason I put that weight loss thing in there, I like people to gain the fat ideally for two and a half years and leave it on for two and a half years and then go on the weight loss.

See a lot of people are afraid of fat.

They're absolutely paranoid of fat.

So, if they see that every six months they can gain and lose and they're not getting huge then they don't worry about it.

So, after a few times, a year goes by, they've done it twice, then they don't worry about gaining a lot of fat and holding it for a year or two.

Then they don't worry about it anymore.

Cause then they know they can get rid of the fat if they will discipline themselves to do the weight loss.

[Attendee]

So, what do you recommend for people who are into body building and fitness and need to have a lower body fat.

[Aajonus]

A low percent body fat is not good for weight lifting.

You have to have a high amount of fat in the muscles to keep them from going into cramping and stiffness.

I talked about that extensively, lactic acid building crystals and making lesions in the muscles.

That's why a lot of body builders and weightlifters don't have a lot of flexibility cause it causes a scar tissue to build up in the muscle.

So, you need lots of fat tissues.

[Attendee]

How long do you find that the weight loss cycle lasts for and how long would you have to do that for.

[Aajonus]

It all depends upon the individual?

[Attendee]

I can gain three pounds in two days and cause I'm so small, it's very, you know, just right away, but the weight loss part.

The satiation is not there.

So, it's hard to really keep it up for days on end with the green juice and the meat.

[Aajonus]

Well, what do is just do a day of regular eating and 3, 4, 5 days of the regular diet, just alternate.

I meant it to be slow loss, cuz your body needs the fat or else it wouldn't be gaining it quickly.

It wouldn't hold onto it.

It needs it inside in the tissues.

.

(69) Weightlifitng, Lactic Acid
[2008],[Attendee]

Did you recommend weight resistance training

[Aajonus]

Any kind of training you want, it's fine all long as you're on a good diet?

There is a problem with some people, Lucky had a problem with his tendons and muscles shrinking up, so he is getting tight and stiff.

That's a sign that you're not digesting your proteins properly.

Also, is sign of collecting lactic acid in the muscles.

So, it creates these crystallization.

It shortens the tendon, shorten the muscles, cuz it lacerate them, causes scar tissue to form, and then you become very stiff.

You see those guys, they're big and Brawny and they can't move.

That's that kind of crystallization that begins with the uric acid buildup and the crystallizations from that causing lesions cutting into it?

So again, a little vinegar if you're heavy into any kind of physical activity.

Make sure you break up that lactic acid with either whey, raw whey, not something you get in a regular health food store, cuz that's always pasteurized and treated, but it has to be a good raw whey or your vinegar.

When you exercise, you have a lactic acid byproduct of utilizing your fuel as energy.

If you are a weight trainer, a weight lifter, any kind of an athlete, you're gonna have a lot of lactic acid buildup and that's a high acidic mineral concentration, and when they collect, they collect into like little bitty, tiny, glass particles, and they can slice it.

They stay in the muscle if you don't dissolve them.

So, you have to make sure they're dissolved, and the lactic acid doesn't build up or else you're going to get stiff and scar.

Remember the stiffness is scarring of those muscles and tendons.

[Attendee]

How much whey would you recommend and is that before or after the workout.

[Aajonus]

It's either way, either before or after?

Because it's not going to be digested entirely all at once, and those nutrients you're gonna stay in the blood.

Probably what I would do if I were to work out and I haven't worked out since 1979, I would drink it while I was working out and continue for about an hour after.

It could be either, not both.

I think both would demineralize you too much and if you're going to workout like that, if you're going to do workouts and be a heavy athlete, it's a good idea you eat a lot of cheese all day long, just sugar cubed size amounts every hour to an hour and a half, make sure you're collecting the poisons.

So, they're not staying in cause those poisons always carry heavy mineral concentrations, and if they start collecting anywhere, you're gonna have those little crystals storing in your tissues, lacerating, causing scarring.

So, it's a good idea to have the cheese going through you, and then when you have the whey or the vinegar, it's going to dissolve the crystals and then they'll be drawn to the digestive tract where the cheese will pull it into the digestive tract and hold onto it like a sponge and pass it out of the body.

[Attendee]

You can just drink as much whey as you want.

[Aajonus]

No, because again, you're gonna demoralize the system?

It's like vinegar, it's just not concentrated like vinegar.

So, if you're an athlete or let's say you're a massage therapist, you're working all day long, you could go through three cups of the whey a day and maybe a teaspoon of vinegar a day broken up into maybe a third of a teaspoon at a time throughout the day.

If you're a ditch Digger or you work with horses, something that causes a lot of physical activity and exertion, you can use the whey throughout today, or a little bit of vinegar throughout the day, space it out.

And if you find you're stiff, you're not taking enough.

If you find that you're getting bleeds and your skin's getting thin and your lips are getting very acidic and starting to burn, then you're not eating enough minerals.

You need more cheese.

(70) What Chicken Is Okay
(71) Why Do Ppl Die Of Cancer, Five Year Death Occurance
[2008],[Aajonus]

They don't usually don't die of cancer unless a particular tumor is blocking their digestive tract or their wind passage

Normally, they die of chemotherapy, radiation therapy of medical treatment, lots of antibiotics.

That's usually what kills people.

Cause people who do this die and then don't get medical therapy, 95% of them survive.

In medical profession only about 50% make it 5 years, and they use the 5 year cutout period, cuz guess what.

In the next year to a year and a half 40 more percent will die?

So, that's why the use of the five year cutoff period, we cured you.

And then if you get an next incident, "Oh no, it's a whole new occurrence, it has nothing to do with the old cancer".

Absolute bullshit.

So, that answer your question.

I mean, there are other things, you can put vinegar on it, but of course, anything that destabilizes it irritates the surrounding cells is not the best way to do it?

You want to nutrify the area.

You want the healthy cells to survive and you've heard of being a flake.

Well, you wanna be a flake sometimes, just flake off those dead cells.
