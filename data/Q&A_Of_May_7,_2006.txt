(1) Cheese With Other Foods
[2006],[Aajonus]

I've said all this stuff already

[Attendee]

Not about cottage cheese.

[Aajonus]

No?

Any kind of cheese, it's the same.

There's no enzyme activity, even in cottage cheese, it's too dry.

So, there's no bacteria that is alive to help utilize the enzymes.

So, it's an absorbent, unless you eat honey with it directly.

Now, you can eat cheese with a milkshake and still, the honey is already united with and chelated and bonded with the fats and the proteins and the other sugars in the food that you're eating.

So, you eat cheese with a milkshake, the honey in it is not going to change the ability of the cheese to absorb and pass out without digestion.

You have to put the honey and the cheese together in the mouth to do that.

Cottage cheese isn't different, just a little dryer.

That's like if you were dead and you were dead and you were half dry, are you more alive when you're half dry than completely dust, a hardened leather.

So, it's like that?

Once you've reached that point of cottage cheese, there's no live bacteria in it anymore to facilitate digestion.

I won't put it in the light, because the light has a tendency to cause fats to go bitter.

Pardon.

I put it in a dark cupboard?

Just get more oxygen in, it'll dry out a little bit more.

It gets the aerobic bacteria to grow faster.

.

(2) Colon Cleans, Prodbiotics
[2006],[Dave]

I did a three month colon cleanse right before just happened and then I kinda started changing drinking a lot of milk and went into the bathroom, really hard like a brick

So, butter will help that.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Well, the colon cleanse destroyed all the bacteria.

[Dave]

Yeah, I washed it out.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely, destroyed it.

[Dave]

So, to rebuild.

Can I use worm probiotics.

[Aajonus]

It doesn't really work, it's not the same bacteria?

Worm casings isn't the same as your own bacteria, E coli.

[Dave]

What would rebuild the intestine.

[Aajonus]

Eating shit?

Eating buffalo shit or cow shit, something like that would get it quicke.

If you want to do it another way, take some soured milk and put it up there as a suppository like you would a light enema.

Only you use soured milk and you put it up in there and you keep it in you, and that would help build the e coli again quickly, they could feed on it.

High meat is also helpful because it's broken down to a point where the bacteria can feed on it readily by the time he gets to the bowel.

You can do it in about two weeks if you don't put it in refrigerator.

I explain how to do that in the recipe book.

You have to open it every 2 days, instead for every 3 - 4.

.

(3) COlostrum
[2006],[Aajonus]

Joe, do you have a question

[Joe]

Colostrum, is that better than regular milk?

[Aajonus]

It depends?

Colostrum is the milk produced by the cow for the first five days after giving birth.

Most of the fat is not in a cream form, it's in a butter form.

Liquid butter form.

So, it is much easier to digest.

Remember I stated before that cream has to go through quite a process, two-thirds have to go through quite a process of the enzymatic activity to separate the H2O from the fat to make it into a butter, to lubricate and strengthen two-thirds of the body's needs.

Only a one-third of the cream can be utilized to help the nervous system, but the other two-thirds of that fat has to be made into like a butter fat.

So, the first five days is a butter fat and not a cream, so it stabilizes that baby as soon as it's born, that calf, as soon as it's born, gives it five days to firm solid, make things more solid in its skin and its hair, everything.

And if it just had cream, it would be anemic.

You having had psoriasis, I'd be eating, butter and cream.

I'm eating sheep's cream right now.

and sheep's butter.

So, you need that lubrication formula.

[Joe]

I'm having it.

[Aajonus]

One a day.

[Joe]

Sometimes two?

[Aajonus]

Keep up 2, as long as you have dryness, you need two a day.

[Attendee]

The money you pay for the extra colostrum is not worth it.

[Aajonus]

Well, for some people it would?

[Attendee #2]

Which conditions is it recommended most for.

[Aajonus]

Digestive problems and skin problems?

Those are the main.

[Attendee #2]

How do they get it when they're not having calves or are they having calves every week.

[Aajonus]

Oh, they've have calves all year round in California?

[Attendee #2]

But only for the first five days does it produce colostrum.

[Aajonus]

They have 450 cows?

They're having cows born every week.

The Amish community, they may have, in their whole community, may have 50 calves born a week, all year round.

It's a little warmer here than it is in New Zealand.

New Zealand has all those high mountains that bring a hell of a cold front.

And here in California, it's year-round, there's lots of them.

There are some months though in winter where they don't have many calves as far as our Amish in Pennsylvania, getting it from them.

They're very limited supply.

But organic pastures, when I was there, they dropped five calves that day.

I was there three years ago in December, first week in December.

.

(4) Detoxing Toxins From Cereals
[2006],[Aajonus]

I'm experimenting for the detoxification book still

I had a month before I had to travel again, so I went on a heavy detoxification trial run.

And again, I was trying to get rid of a lot of the toxicity that was built up in cereals cause I was an addict cereal eater as a child.

[Attendee]

Sugar crisp.

[Aajonus]

Sugar crisp, and 4 tablespoons of sugar in the sugar crisp?

It was already deadly sweet.

So, all that heavy, heavy sugar with the pasteurized dairy, and I'd go through a half gallon to a gallon of pasteurized milk a day.

So, I wanted to work at detoxing that again, and I thought, I got my first parasite almost two years ago, be two years ago in July when I forced that milk and fermentation and the sugar cane juice fermentation.

And the tapeworm lives on sugar byproduct and mainly the people who have tapeworms are people who eat lots of grains, lots of cereals that have no value.

They've been processed like children in Africa that have no food and we give donations to these companies to feed them and then the companies go and give the money to Purina or General Mills or somebody like that, and they send over the worst cereals possible.

Cereal, and water.

So, they make these hundreds of millions of dollars from all these donations and give the worst food they can to these children and all that sugar product forces a tapeworm to eat up the excess sugars, cuz if they don't, they'll just rot.

So, the tapeworm is a good thing for that environment.

So, analyzing that, I thought, well, that tapeworm, I got the tape worm when I was in Cambodian and Vietnam and eating fermented sugar cane and fermented milk and that forced the tapeworm that I had.

And like I said one other time when I talked about it here, I got this craving about three weeks later, I think it was three, three or six weeks, I have to look at my notes and I had craving for onion, so I sat there and ate a half of an onion and next morning, you know, I shat out 45 - 48 feet of a tapeworm and I was devastated cause it took me 38 years from after having the chemotherapy and radiation to get a tapeworm or any kind of parasite because I was so poisoned from the radiation and the chemotherapy that no parasite could live in my body and very few bacterias.

So, I had to do everything in the relationship of solvents, which are virus and that's much more toxic and takes longer and it isn't as efficient.

So, I decided, well, let's see what happens if I go on a milk diet with lots of honey in it and let it get about 24 hours old before I do it and I put it in a bowl of hot water, only about 105Â°, but that's the highest a cow's body temperature gets, unless it goes into fever.

So, I had to leave it in there for about two hours and keep warming the water every 20 - 40 minutes, I did that, added a little cream to it also, so I was drinking anywhere from a half gallon to a gallon of milk a day with that honey in it and after about five days, if you go on the internet and look under dermatological diseases or skin diseases, and you ask for photographs or pictures, you come up with all these different rashes, these different things coming out of the body.

And one of them, it says fix drugs and it has areas, it could be on the penis, it was on somebody's back and on their sides.

That's what I started throwing off, all of these drugs, like chemotherapy and everything, I had lots of diarrhea from it, and it smelled like the chemotherapy I had, which was AZT back in those days.

It was outlawed, the year after they gave it to me was outlawed and then they brought it out of the vaults again when AIDS came up cause they had billions of dollars of it in the vaults and they deemed it too toxic to give to cancer patients.

So, without any testing they said, "Oh, it works for aids", no testing.

They just wanted to get rid of this drug, make money and kill people with aids.

So, anyway, I started detoxing the AZT and I still have it coming out.

Big dry patches all over the place.

My chest and back were just riddled with all these hard sores and then they would come up as hard spots first and then, like this one, comes up as a hard spot and then it'll turn into a scab and it goes deep too, rip it off.

So, I took a few of them, lots around here right now, dissolved them in a distilled water solution and then put 'em under an electronic microscope and then there was lots of crystallized structures that looked like the AZT and other chemicals that I've had, and even mercury molecules in it.

So, started pulling outall this stuff.

So, I've had this for a month now, and sometimes it gets so itchy, especially in my back.

You'll see me rubbing my back up against the wall or a hole going like this because it's so itchy.

Get some sun on it.

Anyway, two weeks ago it was intense.

See how these hard things come out all over and then they'll scab.

Got coming on my arm.

All over my legs, all the way down to my legs and feet.

[Attendee]

So, the detoxing things that you've done up until now were not sufficient to bring this up to the surface.

[Aajonus]

Drugs are hard to get removed because they're so toxic?

So, that's what I was trying to see, how much I could get moving with this and then the parts of the tapeworm came up a few, maybe a month or month and a half, six weeks after I dispelled with the diarrhea after eating the onion.

Then I saw segments again, and then after about probably a total of four months, a shat out another 45 - 50 feet.

I never saw him again, that was the end of it.

No sections, no anything, until I did this milk, fermented milk cleanse again with all that honey in it.

And I was putting a half a cup of honey per half gallon of milk with a little cream in it to force this thing on.

And guess who came up.

Tapeworm showed up again?

About a week ago I saw sections of him coming out again, and every time I have a bowel move, I see a few sections, so he is in there helping me eat up all the sugar damaged tissues, it's dumping into my lungs.

That's just not drug related, it's coming through my skin.

And it's coming out everywhere here, I used to have psoriasis, Joe, you recognize this kind of thing.

I had psoriasis so bad, like when your hands, I had all my elbows, I had on my knees, ankles, everywhere, and I haven't had this kind of condition for what, 30 years.

Something like that?

I didn't know that it was so much chemically related, the psoriasis, because I thought psoriasis is mainly an organic disease that was from mainly cooking foods, especially cooking meats.

It's like causing gout in some people and causing arthritis and rheumatism in others.

But I found that when I did this and all the drugs started coming out and this started happening, in the tissue, the whole area was hard.

Like there were no nerves in it or anything, it just deadened everything and the scraping from here, this was the worst area, and the scraping from there showed the same kind of AZT and the other crystalline toxicities from chemicals.

This is mild to what it was.

[Attendee]

Why did it create the hardening.

[Aajonus]

Why do you think it caused the hardening?

Did you think it was the burning, any of the chemicals coming out or, yeah?

Well, a lot of you have to understand with a chemical like that is already attached to dead cells.

It's already a part of dead cells.

The dead cells just moved out of the bones and out of the other tissue and the, and the, um, ligaments and the tendons moved out to the skin to be, uh, to drop off.

Cause you know, it.

It doesn't come off easily.

It's gotta flake off and die.

But this whole area here is numb.

So, you think detox and then you work on your, your filters first and over a long period of time, you think detox comes out in the cellular level.

Is that, well, that's the, I mean, you can take it after the intestine, but can you imagine this going out through the intestines?

You'd have peritonitis and you'd be very sick and probably die?

So, it has to come out the skin and that's what I've been trying to do is get things out just to see what would happen.

I'm not one that believes in forcing detoxifications, but I think it's just be patient, let it happen over a 40-year period, rather than forcing it.

But when I see the damage that out that chemicals have done in people's bodies from medication, I started thinking, there's some things that are not going to be able to be removed unless you help it.

And I knew that if you take a food that you've eaten a lot of in a cooked for pasteurized form, where all the bacteria and natural products in it that allow it to break itself down and ecologically recycle itself, all those are destroyed in cooking.

So, if a compound in your body, if the structure in your body is made of that kind of compound, there's no way to get it out, unless your body goes through extreme measures like creating virus, which are not alive and are just solvents made by intercellular.

So, that's a long and hard process and can the cells do it with those kinds of drugs and chemicals in the system, which are meant to poison the body.

AZT chemotherapy is meant to poison the body to kill cancer cells, but like I said in We Want To Live, for every one cancer cell, kills 1 billion - 2 billion healthy cells.

Doesn't make any sense.

So, that's why I decided in the last two years experiment with detoxification regimes off putting fermented products in my body that I eat heavily to detox them from the system.

And boy, it sure is working, it works like a charm.

Now I did that a little bit of that in the 70s and 80s with grains.

I'd ferment grains and then take the fermented juice and sometimes a little bit of the fermented grain and eat that.

[Attendee]

Is that the rejuvelac thing.

[Aajonus]

It's like a rejuvelac, but I'd let it go further until little molds would form?

They usually don't let it go that far because molds clean your body naturally like bacteria and parasites do.

Your body resorts to making virus, which are not alive to dissolve things that are too toxic that would destroy and kill any bacteria, parasite, or fungus.

Like candida, giardo, all of those.

Those are natural, those are healthy, but they're for detoxification, even athlete's, foot, all of that stuff.

I've been employing those things for the past two years actually to experiment and see what would happen and it is speeding things, obviously, I didn't know I still had this much in my system and I did not know it was systemic.

Of course, it's gonna be systemic, it goes right into my vein, so it's stored everywhere.

The only place that hasn't broken out was on my face.

I had a few spots on my face and just a few right here on my neck and some bleeding ones here, and then one on my ear here, which bled.

But other than that, no, it wasn't.

(5) Different Dairy Products For Dif Remedies
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, you can get raw milk and you just have to separate it

You get the milk and you separate it.

You get the cream, and then you make cheese with the other and drink the whey.

That's a good balance.

It's funny how dairy can be, you can take milk and you can separate the cream and have the cream or make it into butter, and then you can take the whey from the butter milk And you take the whey from making the cheese and each one of them favors a particular disease.

And if you separate them, they become an individual remedy.

Like the whey is great for arthritis and rheumatism, gout, stuff like that.

You get sore, you get stiff; you drink a cup of whey, almost gone by the next day.

And then you have a 1/2 cup a day after that to keep it away completely.

Depending if you're detoxifying a lot of urea in your body, then you're gonna need 1/2 - 1 cup a day, depending upon the size of your size of body.

And the cheese absorbs toxins cuz cheese is dried, there's no active enzymes in cheese, so there's no bacteria to help the enzymes facilitate enzyme activity.

So, cheese is a detoxifier.

It'll absorb poisons, it'll help magnetize them out of the blood, the lymph and the neurological system, as those fluid channels run through the stomach and intestines.

So, it just attracts it out, and you get all those heavy metals and toxic substances into the bowels or in stomach or in the small intestines, locks onto them and will pass it out without digestion.

If you add honey to the cheese and eat honey directly with the cheese, it turns it into a mineral supplement.

And then of course, the butter is the only thing that'll lubricate the bones and the skin and the tendons and the lymph system very well.

And the cream is the only thing that will sooth and completely take care of the nervous system.

So even though you can other elements of food, you can't separate like that and then have a favorable thing happen.

Now, if you take a tribe like the Fulani of the Samburu, and you start separating those too much and too often, and then it'll cause them imbalances.

.

(6) Don;t Eat Seaweed Or Nori Sheets, Salt
[2006],[Aajonus]

And you were eating seaweed with it every time

[Attendee]

Yeah, it did have this like sprinkle?

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, that's salt.

That's what's causing your mind to go, hyperactivity.

[Attendee]

And then I went out to the Volcano National Park and they have all those sulfuric ephemeral holes and checking out those.

And then I went out for a hike and I was just like.

[Aajonus]

Oh, you breathed in some sulfur.

[Attendee]

Yeah.

[Aajonus]

Woo.

And you had already had the salt, which dries out the system and then your brain must have just closed.

Don't ever have seaweed, high in salt, dry your system and cause you to be hyperactive.

[Attendee #2]

It doesn't have mercury.

[Aajonus]

Well, they have some, and again, when it's cooked and dried like that, it's cooked?

And it releases all the heavy metals in it.

[Attendee #2]

But when the seaweed is growing in sea, it's incorporating that just like it is you utilizing anything in the garden.

That salt has been taken through and changed.

It's like the minerals in the soil.

[Aajonus]

But it lives in a salt water environment.

That's a different environment.

The concentration of sodium in that plant is very different from a plant you'll have here on the earth.

You put that concentration of sodium in the soil there, and it will kill everything here.

[Attendee #2]

Well, when I use sea salt on my plants it doesn't do that, it does the opposite.

It doesn't kill them at all.

[Aajonus]

Where.

[Attendee #2]

I've been doing it for years?

[Aajonus]

No, no.

I'm talking about a salt water environment.

I'm not talking about putting a little bit of salt.

[Attendee #2]

I mean, I used to get it by the trailer load and put it around the farm closed.

[Aajonus]

In those mulch that you buy.

[Attendee #2]

No, no?

Off the beach.

[Aajonus]

You're buying it and you put it there.

[Attendee #2]

I've done that for years?

[Aajonus]

What plants did you fertilize with it.

[Attendee #2]

All my vegetable done have been done with seaweed?

[Aajonus]

And how did you mulch it.

[Attendee #2]

Chopped it, and put there?

[Aajonus]

You didn't mulch it first.

[Attendee #2]

I do both?

I used to make compost and I used to put it round the plants.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

If it's composted, it'll break it down.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah, I understand, but I just put it round the plants and I had friends have done it.

[Aajonus]

If you put it on top, it's just gonna dry up.

It's not gonna leak down into it till it breaks down.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah, but you put straw on top so that it won't dry out.

Otherwise, it doesn't lock down as quickly.

[Aajonus]

But it's gotta break down to release the sodium.

But how much of it going to hit the plant.

[Attendee #2]

Well, it all does cause you do it all the time gradually?

But I mean, it doesn't kill it.

I don't even wash it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but we don't have dirt in our body to filter it out.

[Attendee #2]

I realize that, but what I'm saying is that much, you only have a little bit of salt.

Is it really that bad for you for all the minerals you put it with it.

[Aajonus]

Well, you're asking what I've seen?

Yes.

It causes what it did with him.

It causes dehydration of the brain.

.

(7) Eggs, Milk and Meat Digestion Time, Eat Eggs and Sulpher In Eggs and Milk
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, usually when somebody is very, very ill, they're not digesting their food properly, so they can't digest complex nutrients

They can't digest meat, they can't digest sometimes even milk, even though that's already liquid, when you look at an egg, all of the fat and all of the proteins are in complete liquid form.

So, there's just a fraction of the digestive time.

It takes 10 minutes to completely digest an egg.

Completely digested, absorbed, and already in your blood, in your nervous system, everywhere in your system.

Milk can take hour, couple of hours, 5 or 6 hours, even meat, 16 - 20 hours.

[Attendee]

Raw.

[Aajonus]

Even raw, because it's a hard substance, has to be broken down?

So, if you're eating eggs, you don't have to spend all that energy and digestion and you going to heal and you can cleanse and you can recuperate.

That's why that woman I talked about that gave us an example in the Recipe Book that had emphysema that was supposed to die that weekend and she'd been on oxygen for almost 2 years and had been diagnosed 7 years previously and hadn't been out of the bed much in two years was out of the bed and walking around and off the oxygen in two days of eating eggs, 66 eggs over a two day period, 33 a day.

The eggs can do that, but that's the only food that I can see that can create that miracle kind of experience with almost everybody who eats them.

There are other people, you you can give them combinations or selective foods and it'll change her whole life instantly, but it doesn't work on everybody or most people.

But the eggs will work on almost everybody.

People with environmental sensitivities that come to me and they can't eat anything.

They can maybe drink water or they'll have an allergic reaction to even water, put 'em on the eggs and they can live on the eggs.

[Attendee]

And the sulfur in the eggs, is that a problem.

[Aajonus]

It's not a concentrated sulfur?

It's a lot of sulfur, but it's within the balance with the fat and the protein.

If it were a problem, you'd better believe I would be a mess.

[Attendee]

I'm trying to understand why it's not a problem, so I can apply that logic in situations.

[Aajonus]

The milk's very high in sulfur too, but it's not a problem.

It's just not as as digestible as easily absorbable and utilizable an egg.

.

(8) Esophageal Cancer
[2006],[Aajonus]

So, I didn't mean not to give your sister-in-law any hope, but it's one that scares me because it's so difficult, it's hard

When you see a cancer patient with lung cancer trying to get up the stairs or exhausted.

Their lungs are filling up, they can't breathe.

They're stopping and panting, and that's the way it is.

And it could take 3 - 5 years to get through that stage.

Will they get through that stage without running to the doctors and the doctors are promising this, "Oh, well, we will cut it out and you'll be okay or we'll give you radiation therapy and you'll be okay or chemo and you'll be fine".

And they always tell them this.

.

(9) Finding Raw Dairy In Asian Countrie, Get From Muslims
[2006],[Aajonus]

You'll find a lot there

If they don't have it, you ask, you find out what is the word for raw.

If you go into, let's say Thailand and you say, um, let's say, neux dib, raw meat.

Now, neux dib to them can mean usually by the way they eat now, Old tribes, people would know neux dib means raw meat, like we eat it.

But neux dib to most of the younger Thai's means you're eating meat alone without anything dressing with it, but it's still cooked.

So, I have to say neux dib, suit suit, my suk, means no cooking.

I have to go through this whole thing to describe it.

So, you have to learn how to say to get exactly specifically what you want.

[Attendee]

Brush up on your Hindi.

[Aajonus]

Yeah and let's say you learn 50 words and you can get all the foods you need that's all, ask for the food correctly.

And in Thailand it's very difficult to find milk, unless you ask and almost all of the Muslims.

Lots of Muslims in Asia, tremendous amount of Muslims, they do dairy.

They've got goats, they've got cows, they've got milk, but they never take it to the markets.

So, you see somebody you know wearing a a Muslim outfit they always have the best meat too.

I always buy my meat from them cause they knew how to raise those animals.

They're healthy, they're hearty, the people and their animals.

So, I always buy from them and I'll say, can I get some raw milk.

I say in Thai and they bring me goat milk or cows milk?

They'll have a certain day that they'll bring it.

.

(10) Getting Sick In Other Countries, Vaccines
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, you're already used to bacteria, so when you start getting bacteria in other countries, it's not foreign to your body, so it just adapts to a new bacteria

Also, there's the issue that when somebody goes to a foreign country, they're told not to eat anything raw, so they'll eat everything cooked.

Then they have no enzymes, and they'll go into diarrhea, sickness, and cold.

For example, there's a movie called Latino that was shot in 1984, and it was written and directed by Haskell Wexler and one of my patients was the third lead in the movie Tony Plano and Tony Plano got this legalized legal size sheet of paper, both sides with literature on it.

It was everything was kind of like this, everything was centered, so it didn't take up all of the page, it would've all fit onto one page.

They weren't so creative in the way they designed it.

It was everything you should not do, and it's everything that you do on this diet was not to do.

You don't drink the water, unless it's boiled.

You don't eat any food, unless it's cooked or steamed, including fruit.

Even watermelon, you steam everything.

If you go outside, you always wash your hands before you touch your face.

It was endless about what you cannot do.

So, he is handed me that and he says, what do you think.

I said, "Tony, if you do the opposite, if you drink the swamp water, if put all that bacteria everywhere?

You eat your raw meat, you eat your raw eggs, you get some raw dairy".

And they shot it in Nicaragua.

And it was about the American interference in Nicaragua at the time, uh, by Bush and Reagan.

And, and he did exactly as I said.

He was the only one out of the 42 people on that set, we're talking about cast and crew.

Only one who did not get sick.

Robert Beltran, who was the lead, got so sick he lost 50 pounds.

They had to write a whole new segment into there showing he got sick cuz he lost 40-50 pounds, could have been more.

Shut down the film for two and a half months he was so sick Robert did a little bit of the diet before he went down there, but he didn't eat anything raw while he was down there and everything was processed and cooked.

[Attendee]

Whether it's Africa, Asia, South Africa.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter?

[Attendee]

Getting that indigenous bacteria in.

[Aajonus]

It's fine.

It just adapts as long as you're used to eating bacteria.

You're already adapted, this whole garbage about, "Oh, let's vaccinate you, but watch bacteria".

Wait a minute, you're injecting disease into me and you want me to adapt to that, and you don't want me to adapt to the natural bacteria that's in everyday life.

What are you crazy?

Precisely, they are nuts?

They're out of their mind.

(11) How To See If Honey Is Heated
[2006],[Aajonus]

Just remember, always take it and put it on your tongue and let it sit in your throat

If it eats at your throat, it burns your throat almost starts you coughing.

It is definitely heated and that's the way I test it.

.

(12) Isolated Nutrients, Plants Eat Rock
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, yeah, it has to do with all of it

Very complex.

A man has his head up his butt because he can't even make anything grow.

He can't make an apple from scratch or seed from scratch that grows.

He always has to use other elements of nature and to think that he's smart enough to make something a balance is absolute stupidity because their intelligence, micro intelligence, microcosmic and macrocosmic intelligence that are all partaking in the exchange of building something.

Isn't this one human brain that's working it all out, that's pure stupidity.

And when you cook something and you chemically treat it, you've gotten rid of all of those other cosms and you're just working on one and that's mainly where plants live.

Most of those things you can feed plants, but if you put too much sodium somewhere, you'll kill certain plants.

You put too much sulfur somewhere, you'll kill.

Plants do the same thing, but plants eat rock.

That's what they do, they eat non bioactive substances.

The rain comes down, dissolves rocks and they eat it.

But we know that trees and plants will grow even faster and fuller if you're using biochemical mulch where there is decaying vegetation or human excrement or animal excrement around, it'll thrive.

For example, I have a fern that was an indoor fern.

The container was about this big, and it was about this full and I planted it in my garden because the deer and the golfers eat everything.

They don't leave anything for me, the only thing I can grow is peppermint or spear mint.

I got spearmint growing all over and this fern and the jasmine, they don't seem to eat- the one year they loved Jasmine, most of time they don't.

So, I planted this one little bitty fern out there about three years ago, so I didn't fertilize it at all the first year and it grew, it probably doubled in its size as ferns spread.

And the next year I thought, hmm, I'm gonna see what will happen if I punch it with a lot of human nitrogen.

So, I collected my urine and I collected my eggshells, and I blended the eggshells, until they were a powder.

I mixed it with my urine and took some Terramin clay and put a little bit of that in there and then I went around.

I took a container with a lid and poked holes in, went around, sprinkling it all over the dirt around there.

Everything doubled that year.

So then last year, I'm not gonna put the hole in the cap, I'm just going to dump the stuff.

I always do it in February, low season when it's cold and when things aren't thriving at that time, they're all about to come out in the springtime, about to blossom.

I'm just pouring it on the dirt and it quadrupled.

The fern now goes from that wall to here and it goes from that post to here.

That's one year growth from when I just poured it on.

Now, if you take urine from an animal that each cooked food, like human urine or dog urine that's grown up on Alpo and canned foods, it will actually burn and ruin the roots not help it grow.

It will destroy growth.

And here I saw mine was causing all this tremendous growth.

[Attendee]

That fern is getting water from an irrigation system.

[Aajonus]

Uh, no?

It has a sprinkler system.

So, it gets water about every three days.

.

(13) Lung & Esophogeal Cancer
[2006],[Aajonus]

That's a hard one, it's a very difficult one if it's advanced

The two that I don't like to handle because they're so difficult is lung and esophageal.

Lung, because the lungs keep filling up with fluid and it takes medical intervention to get the fluid out of the lungs and they'll usually puncture the lungs and then pull it out and you keep poking the lungs like that, it doesn't help.

So, it's very, very difficult.

Only 60% of those that I've worked with reversed, medical profession, none reverse unless they remove the lungs.

And then there's usually a 5 - 6 year period when they're dead.

That's the longest they live, but about 90% of them die within a few years of getting lung cancer.

Usually, if they get treatment, they'll die within a few months, unless they have surgery.

[Attendee]

She's against any kind, chemotherapy or stuff like that or radiation.

[Aajonus]

But still, if her lungs keep filling up with fluid, which it does to help eliminate it, she has to be able to cough it up to get it out of the body or else it has to be aspirated through medical needs and that's complicated and that creates sores, which makes more fluid collect in the lungs, so it's difficult.

Esophageal is bad because it'll choke off the vocal, the esophagus, the ability to breath and eat.

You can't breathe and eat, you're dead.

So, that's a difficult.

The worst case I had was after it was removed, the man had esophageal cancer all the way down, so what they did was they, they had maybe three inches of esophagus left.

So, they cut it all out, put his, put his stomach up in his shoulder, and his lungs way over here, so it was all attached right into his throat.

So, the guy was on constant meds, and he was in constant pain and he died even though he went on the diet and did it 100%, it only allowed him to live for another year and a half, year and three months.

He should have been dead probably within a month, month and a half.

But he suffered that whole time, even on the diet, it reduces pain by 50%, so he's taking less meds, but it was still very difficult.

A difficult situation.

Then there's some people who catch it early enough and they go on the diet and they'll get colds and flus and keep bringing the stuff up properly with the mucus, instead of water.

Well, if she has fluid already collecting, then egg every half hour or her waking hour, little honey and butter in between.

And that's what she should eat until she gets the strength, until she builds the mucus instead of fluid, should be all the almost exclusively that.

Raw eggs, one every half hour and maybe a teaspoon of honey and butter, equal parts of honey and butter.

1/2 teaspoon - 1 teaspoon every 15 minutes after each egg.

[Attendee]

How about vegetable juice like celery.

[Aajonus]

Cause water to build up in the lungs, unless she sips it?

[Attendee]

Is there any way you can have a consultation with her if she comes to this space.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, it depends on when she would come.

.

(14) Lung Cancer and Surgery Is Best Medical Therapy
[2006],[Aajonus]

Surgery, I've seen with lung cancer, I've seen less deaths in probably the medical therapy, the surgery helps people live a lot longer

One woman had, I don't know if you remember who she is, Laurine Tuttle, she's like my second grandmother and very good dear friend of mine, and she got lung cancer in 1969 and she had, this is just when I was barely a cripple myself.

She wouldn't eat the raw meat, she would eat it rare, but she wouldn't eat it completely raw.

She only had three lobes of a lung, half of her lungs gone.

And she did quite well.

Also I knew John Wayne and John Wayne had just one lobe left, and he lived three years with just one lobe, but he was an alcoholic.

He just stayed numb all the time, destroyed all bacteria cuz he was drunk all the time.

But he was able to survive that.

But he was not a happy person and nobody liked him because when he was drunk, he was just obnoxious, constantly obnoxious.

So, people can survive with medical therapy, but what is the quality of life.

But the surgery, although Harbin B?

Jones says that he thought that surgery was the worst therapy that you could do, I think that surgery is the least harmful of the therapies in my experience of medical intervention.

In a case of cancer, there's definitely 60% chance you'll live doing this diet.

And if you go with the medical profession, probably 17% chance you'll live over 5 years.

And that's why the medical profession pulls out this magic number 5 years.

Do you know that if you reached the magic number 5 years, you're considered cured of cancer.

No matter if the next day or next year, you get it again, they consider it a whole new case of cancer, which they cured you the first time?

It's all pharmaceutical double talk to get you to do what they want you to do.

.

(15) Malaria
[2006],[Aajonus]

I've gone to the swamps; I've swam in and I drank the water

[Attendee]

Have you been bitten by mosquitoes.

[Aajonus]

Well, I don't get bit by mosquitoes very often, unless I eat watermelon?

And if I eat watermelon, they're on me within 5 -6 hours.

I end up eating a piece of watermelon every time I'm in Asia, so I do get maybe 10 bites out of two months, which is nothing.

They get eaten alive and I've never gotten malaria, it's all absolute stupidity.

.

(16) Msm & Sulphur
[2006],[Attendee]

MSM

[Aajonus]

It's a terrible thing?

It's sulfur and sulfur dries out the system, it's like an antibiotic.

They used to use sulfur as an antibiotic for kidney diseases and stuff like that, sinus diseases.

MSM is a dangerous substance.

Sure, it'll stop detoxifications and it'll get rid of your symptoms, but it makes the body worse.

Sulfur stores in the body, can't break sulfur down, especially when it's that concentrated.

I find in people all the time, it creates serious mental problems later down the line, or intestinal.

Sometimes it's systemic.

But it just dries out the system and back in the early 70s, there was a- it was 60 minutes or 20 minutes, one of those.

They did a segment on women who spontaneously combust.

[Attendee #2]

They showed it recently.

[Aajonus]

Really.

Only women were taking that kind of sulfur drug to do it?

[Attendee]

What would happen.

[Aajonus]

What would happen was they'd be standing there and they spontaneous went up into flames?

Not around any fire or anything, just went up in flames.

[Attendee]

Is this real or science fiction.

[Aajonus]

No, this is real?

And they showed the burns of the body and everything.

One woman, 2/3 or 3/4 of her body had been burned.

It was pretty bad, third degree.

[Attendee]

Did she die.

[Aajonus]

No, she survived and this was, I think somewhere around 1967-1969 that happened to her?

This show was built and aired about 1972.

And then they showed other women, two other women who had gone through the same experience, but not as much as their bodies.

So, I was racking my brain out at that time trying to figure out what would cause those women to spontaneously combust.

I knew it had to be a chemical related to nitroglycerine, that if it had a certain sulfur base, as soon as the oxygen would touch it, it'd go up in flames.

So, that was a year later when I figured that out.

So, I thought, Hmm, I wonder.

So, I called a friend of mine who was the head of publicity at MGM and I said, "Listen, I need this to find out who these women were.

I need their names or phone numbers or addresses where I can write or call them".

So, he gave me the number of the show.

Like I said, I don't remember if it was 60 minutes or 20, and I called the show and they got permission to give me the numbers.

So, I called the three women and the one who had had the worst burns had been on sulfur drugs for 32 years for kidney problems.

The other woman who was next, I think a third of her body burned, she had been on the drugs for 27 and the woman who had burned about a quarter of her body or a little less, 20% of her body had been on for 13-17 years.

Something like that.

Sulfur is not a natural thing.

No element in nature is high in the body, except for calcium, potassium, and phosphorus.

But the potassium and phosphorus don't hold up in the system.

They're very transient.

Calcium is more stable in the system, sulfur is a very small part of the human body or any animal's body, and if it gets high, it will cause dryness, severe dryness.

Most of your Dristan's, your antihistamines are full of sulfur.

Can you imagine, the body's trying to get rid of the poisons through the mucus discharge, and you're gonna dry it up with sulfur.

What's going to happen?

The poisons that the body is trying to reject with the mucus are going to remain in the tissue.

So, you're going to have more advanced and chronic disease as the years go by cuz you're not gonna be cleaning out the system.

[Attendee]

That is why my father that's got these sinus problems, he did all the antihistamines and keep making it worse.

.

(17) Next Book On Detox
(18) Nothing Is Theoretical
[2006],[Attemdee]

Actually Aajonus, I've been on a track similar to yours, but not nearly as long, and, and I've studied several different people and so I'm really just interested in the parallels that you have to offer to all the other people I studied

I've taken a lot and thrown it away and taken the good and saved it, so I just have to compliment you.

I think you're on the track.

If I could say anything at I'd say, I've learned that that life exists on a physical, a mental, emotional, and a spiritual plain, and then you can be balanced.

So, I would treat everything in a balance like that.

So, it's not really a question, it's just a compliment.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

I'm interested in what works, not with theoretical.

Like I said, when I wrote the book, all of my books, I was putting in there what works, and all the explanation was just theory.

This is probably why it works, but we're not that smart to be able to say this is absolutely what it is.

People like science, they like logic, and they like rationale.

So, to me it's all bullshit and I'll give it to them.

If that's what they need, but that doesn't really mean that is the reason The meat works, hhe meat helps heal the body.

The eggs help rebuild and revitalize the body faster than anything else.

The butter helps lubricate the body and keep it good and solid firm and the cream soothes and relaxes the body.

So, these things are the key answers that I have and how to combine it to get people out of the diseases is how I've been.

(19) Org Pastures Milk To 32 Deg
[2006],[Aajonus]

We get all of our dairy for our group, our buyer's group from the Amish

We don't buy anything at Organic Pastures.

Cause when he went to 32Â° for everything, his milk, now he's denying it.

As soon as it comes out, he puts it 32Â°.

I told people about it and now he's lying that he doesn't do that.

He does.

temperature.

[Attendee]

What temperature should it be.

[Aajonus]

I like I told him it shouldn't go below 45Â°?

Milk won't freeze at 32Â°, unless it's held there for many hours and it's not churned.

[Attendee]

Why do they do that.

[Aajonus]

Bacteria?

Bacteria.

Afraid of bacteria.

So, Mark McAfee, who owns and runs it, he put all of it in his son's name, so he doesn't own anything now cuz he knows he owes me, he owes James Stewart.

He owes Martin Sheen, we got these people, Martin Sheen, his wife put in like 40 grand and he hasn't paid him back a dime.

He keeps saying, oh, we'll pay you, we'll pay you.

He just keeps getting bigger and he goes around bragging he makes $3 million a year already and he doesn't pay us.

And he went from glass to plastic and then he went from 39Â° - 32Â° and chilling.

It just gets worse and worse.

And he goes around the world, he goes around, literally around the world bragging that he has the best dairy in the world.

He's nowhere near the Amish, any of them.

They're very good because they are on my diet, those farmers are on my diet.

A lot of the Amish are on my diet now too.

A lot of those people are supplying us with foods are getting on the diet cuz they're finding out it's working for them.

[Attendee]

Does Amos Miller.

[Aajonus]

Amos doesn't, but some of the others around us, Amos has talked about it and he says he's gonna start doing it and I think he has, but he hasn't come back and says, yes, I'm doing it?

[Attendee]

I didn't realize the fact that you said it was all cooled.

We didn't know that.

I was trying to support the Californian dairy, but I didn't know that they took it to 32Â°, you hadn't told me.

[Aajonus]

I said it here.

, it's the second time I said it.

[Attendee #2]

Organic Pastures, that's from Whole Foods, right.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it's California dairy?

It's still better than nothing.

He also goes around bragging that he's purely grass fed, he feeds them grain at the time of milking, and he was feeding them cooked grain for a while.

He was giving them rolled oats and then he was giving them a rice bran one time and it was making the milk really bitter and nasty because there's gibberellic acid in rice bran, and this guy, even though he was raised on a dairy farm, has no clue about dairy farming.

He left it as soon as he got out of high school, cuz all he did was milk, that's obviously all he paid attention to from his father and mother, cuz when he decided to make a lot of money and a killing going into the raw, organic dairy business, he saw big money there and didn't learn as he should.

[Attendee #2]

Why can't somebody else do it in California.

[Aajonus]

You know how much it costs to set up a dairy?

Extraordinary?

Extraordinary amount of work.

Extraordinary amount.

[Attendee]

How about converting one of the other commercial.

[Aajonus]

If you can get 'em to do it?

Very difficult.

But I tried to get one of the Stuvy Brothers up in Northern California, you know, Stuvy used to be the raw dairy here, and they kept promising that they would do it and they didn't.

And then Mark Mcafee came around and got all this money together for him, and he did it and now he doesn't give a shit about us.

He wouldn't have never been in the business without us.

[Attendee]

How much did you guys give him.

[Aajonus]

Well, altogether we gave him about, well he had already had the dairy going, but he was selling to Horizon, but he doubled his herd and plus he started making cheese, so we loaned him almost a $100,000 altogether and he hasn't paid, I think, but maybe $15,000 of it back?

[Attendee]

So, what can you buy.

[Aajonus]

You'd have to go to Arizona to get it or have them ship it to you?

That's why I have everything shipped to us, we truck it to us every week in LA, but I've got these Amish people who send it to Aruba.

I've got patients in Aruba that have it shipped all the way there.

[Attendee #2]

You know everything that's available in LA, it's available up here.

We have a Co-op; you order once a month.

[Aajonus]

And you're getting the same dairy we have up there, so we're getting it from the Amish in Pennsylvania.

[Attendee]

How long would the milk last.

[Aajonus]

It'll be sour?

Raw dairy never goes bad.

It just turns into bitter cheese.

So, if you don't mind eating soured milk, it's fine.

[Attendee]

Can you put honey in it.

[Aajonus]

You can put a little honey in it, it'll last couple of weeks without starting to turn?

[Attendee]

But at the turn will it be a little bit sweeter.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it's sweeter?

Yes, definitely, it's sweeter and it's more digestive.

More sour it is the more digestible it is, so it's fine.

Just may not be as enjoyable.

Once it's kefir and it separates, all you do is shake it and it's right back emulsified again.

.

(20) Psoriasis
[2006],[Aajonus]

I didn't know that it was so much chemically related, the psoriasis, because I thought psoriasis is mainly an organic disease that was from mainly cooking foods, especially cooking meats

, it's like causing gout in some people and causing arthritis and rheumatism in others.

But I found that when I did this and all the drugs started coming out and this started happening, in the tissue, the whole area was hard.

Like there was no nerves in it or anything, it just deadened everything.

In the scraping from here, this was the worst area, and the scraping for there showed the same kind of AZT and the other crystalline toxicities from chemicals.

This is mild to what it was.

.

(21) Recommended Water
[2006],[Attendee]

I have a couple short questions and then like one that I'd like to elaborate for, like sun exposures, is that fine

Do you encourage that?

[Aajonus]

Yes, sun is very important?

[Attendee]

And then weat germ, do you like wheat germ.

[Aajonus]

Wheat germ, like I said in the book, there's no pure wheat germ?

Tthey have to solvent process or heat process.

[Attendee]

How much water do you recommend people go hydrate with.

How often and best sources of glass water?

[Aajonus]

Gerolsteiner is my favorite, but that's higher in carbon dioxide and it's the carbon dioxide from the well?

Well, it looks like now Perrier is no longer buying the gas that they've lost in their well from them, so they're using an artificial.

So, there's still Gerolsteiner, there's Ramlosa.

[Attendee]

And sometimes that will come in plastic, but you don't recommend any plastic.

[Aajonus]

I don't get any water in plastic and water's the worst thing you could do besides the acid juices in plastic?

.

(22) Vegetable Juice With Eggs, Vegetarians
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, I found that if you have lots of eggs that it causes a certain amount of acidity cause of the dryness and it starts pulling out a lot of toxins

And by having the green vegetable juice, it helps replenish and rebalance the system.

[Attendee]

But you don't want too much, you didn't want it every day.

[Aajonus]

No?

[Attendee]

Why is that.

[Aajonus]

Because it interferes with the digestion of the eggs?

[Attendee]

Because it's two alkaline.

[Aajonus]

I can theorize that, but I don't know?

I can theorize why.

[Attendee]

But you found once every four days it's better than once every day.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends.

Three days, three to four days.

Some people can go five days without having a juice.

I found that it does interfere when you're eating like an egg every half an hour to an hour and that's mainly what you're eating.

[Attendee]

Just quickly then from the following on from the alkalinity, everyone now writes books and says if you're drinking alkaline pH water, like 7.

4, you're not going to have cancer, etc cause cancer and all the chronic diseases of the day are result of acidy in the system that there's less oxygen in the system.

Can you just quickly, because everyone who comes to people who own themselves and say this, this is what's being spread.

What do you have to say about this.

[Aajonus]

Theoretical bullshit?

You said a short answer, that's theoretical bullshit.

There's no evidence of that.

You take a look at the clinics like The Optimal Health Institute, here near San Diego, or where is it.

Lemon Grove and you've got one in Florida?

2/3 of those people drop dead in less than 5 years.

2/3 dropped dead within five years from that experience, and most of them do very badly.

There used to be several therapists there that found out my method worked better so undercover they had their meat and everything illegally in their rooms and little coolers or little bitty refrigerator and they were sending people to me.

One woman they sent had multiple myeloma and she had just come from the ISL clinic to there, and nobody gave her hope.

I put her on a diet in 30 days, her multiple myelomas reversed.

That kind of alkalinity, that whole idea is a stupid concept, it is really a ridiculous concept.

[Attendee]

Acidic conditions can cause problems, so you're saying it's a balance between the two, not just extremely one or the other.

[Aajonus]

No, I would say probably you're going to get more disease if you go on alkaline for a long time for the human body cause the human body is like all other animals?

All other omnivore and carnivore animals are mainly acidic.

Their urine, their saliva is acidic.

Children should not have vegetable juice under 16 years old unless they absolutely crave it, and it will disrupt their whole digestion because it causes over alkalinity, your digestive juices and bacteria must be acid in your digestive tract to digest any animal products.

We know we're not vegetarian, very few people can sustain human life on vegetation.

That's why there are very few vegetarians that don't get cancer and do very well, and I've only met 8/3000 people who could accomplish being pretty good vegetarians, they were even athletic but that was cuz they had all this high testosterone, high adrenaline, and high thyroxine, and even a couple of 'em had high thymus productions, but that's what generated their health.

So, they were naturally very over acidic because of those hormones secretions so they could take all that alkaline food and do okay with it.

But the longest term one I met, he was on that raw food hygiene program, raw food alkaline with no meat, no eggs, no dairy for 52 years, and then all of a sudden, his whole spine started disintegrating.

He used to come to the health shows that I did, and he'd be one of those hecklers of the audience.

And he said, "Well, I've been vegetarian for 47, 48", every year he'd show up that I was speaking, and then all of a sudden, it's 52, he didn't show up anymore because he was doing my diet, because his spinal cord just started disintegrating.

He was in excruciating pain, he couldn't live.

He became an invalid and then when he started eating the raw meat and raw dairy, well, he mainly eat raw eggs and raw meat and kept the dairy down, he still has a hell of the prejudice against dairy, but he'll use the butter and he was back on his feet within about six months.

So, but he doesn't tell people, he tells people to still do the hygiene and vegetarian die.

He eats the meat and eats some dairy, but that's a mentality.

So, we're not vegetarians.

We need acid bacteria, we need acid digestive juices to break down meats and, and dairy and eggs, that's the nature of it.

And if you're trying to digest fiber, it's not going to happen because we have 2.

5x less digestive tract than an herbivore.

We have one stomach, the duodenum and the herbivores have from 2 - 4 and they have 60,000x more enzyme to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the protein and the fats.

We can't do that, so their B12 goes down and they're sucking up this processed soy garbage as they're protein.

50% of my cancer clients were long-term vegetarians, 50%.

It was people like Linda McCartney.

"I'm vegetarian and I'll never get cancer".

She died of the most aggressive breast cancer there is.

[Attendee]

Are you linking her cancer to your vegetarianism.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

You're alkalinizing the body and you're feeding it bad proteins, processed soy and nuts, grains that you can't digest.

If you're a bird you can digest nuts or you're a squirrel, but we're not those.

.

(23) Vegetable Juice, Vegejuice For Children
[2006],[Aajonus]

So, all that alkalinity is not what we're supposed to be

I used the vegetable juice cause we're so toxic.

We have so many acids, we're over acidic from all the cooked foods that we've had.

[Attendee]

See, that's confuses me.

[Aajonus]

So, that helps balance it a little bit, we put in those alkalizing minerals, they attach to the acid minerals and could neutralize them so it doesn't interfere with us.

But children, even though they're eating cooked diets only need maybe 1/2 a cup once every two weeks, even if they're eating cooked foods.

If they're eating raw foods, unless they were born to a very, very toxic mother, and those toxins went from the mother to the infant to the fetus, only they should have just a minute amount of vegetable juice.

I got one two year old on the diet and she has signs of she looks like she was born to a vegetarian woman.

Now, the mother had been vegetarian for six years before she went onto my diet, ultra skinny.

Well, she didn't recover enough and I told her, don't have a baby now, you wait seven years til shes been on the diet.

She had a baby.

I think she's got pregnant within 6 months as she got gained all this weight, she felt so good and she said, "I'm healthy enough to have a child".

I said, "No, you're not".

So, she had this baby and this baby looks like it's been a 20 year vegetarian.

More than half of its body is full of dead cells.

[Attendee]

How can you tell the body is half dead cells.

[Aajonus]

In the irises if there's a lot of scar tissue and I can see how much of the body proportion and 50% of that child's body is dead cells?

[Attendee]

Wow.

That's terrible.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

And another vegetarian that had a baby, well, she had a fetus growing and it miscarried at about five months old, the baby was see through.

You can look at it, it looked like a plastic baby, translucent.

You can see the veins and the arteries and all the different parts as if it were this plastic model.

And when we looked at the tissue and it was all nerve tissue, she had had spinal cancer and brain cancer.

So, her body took all these dead cells and built them into the fetus to get 'em out of her system.

She called him her angel.

She had something like 60 tumors in her spinal cord and brain altogether, and she reversed so many of those cancers dissolved during that pregnancy.

But the body took those cancer cells and put dead brain cells, the neurons and built them into this fetus.

This baby was built out of tumorous nerve tissue that was translucent, it's the wildest thing I've ever seen.

So, the body does phenomenal things and when a mother comes off of vegetarianism, just cuz she gets on the diet or anybody gets on this diet, they're not infallible.

You have to be careful.

This woman had that baby way too soon and now the baby shows signs of anemia.

can't digest well, just like a 40 year old vegetarian.

[Attendee]

But she's gotta be better off than a vegetarian having a baby as a vegetarian.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah, definitely.

Well, this woman's smoker too and she never stopped smoking, so that added to the problem.

[Attendee]

Hundreds of thousands of vegetarians have babies.

[Aajonus]

Yep.

But this woman was a smoker too, so that contributed to it so there was a lot of damage in this child.

Now, at two years old, the child's going for the raw meat and is starting to gradually move out of that, so it's thankful she's able to.

Some children who are raised like that in a vegetarian type system, the meat repulses them, and they will never eat it and never recover properly.

But this child, all of a sudden, two weeks ago to start devouring the raw meat.

[Attendee]

Why does the meat repulse them.

[Aajonus]

Because they have so much alkalinity in their intestines and systems that they don't have the acids to break down the meat, so it repulses it?

A lot of vegetarians can't go into eating meat within the vegetarian diet if they continue eating salads and drink a lot of juices.

The meat repulses them because they don't have the digestive juices to handle the meat, they'll start vomiting.

The food will pass through, go into diarrhea, all kinds of problems.

(24) West Nile Vairus
[2006],[Aajonus]

With the aids, they put it in the smallpox vaccine, was given to 75 million people

Guess how many countries, the World Bank now runs those countries.

27 of those African countries cuz they said, "Oh, you've got this disease, we'll help you, but you have to pay us back?

We'll give you all this medical supplies, all this chemotherapy to help your people survive this AIDS epidemic that you have, but you are indebted to us".

Governments can never pay back, so guess what.

They now own the resources of those 27 countries?

It's a different way of playing war.

No bombs just go in there and poison them, get them sick, and take over their assets.

So, now America and England, the UK, those banks run that country from UK and and United States.

Not a nice thing.

They don't care.

And the Ebola, according to Dr.

Leonard Horowitz, he shows all the records that show that Ebola and West Nile is all created by again, the military mission.

[Attendee]

As far as avoiding getting any of these things or healing.

[Aajonus]

You keep away from injections, you don't let a needle get near you and you'll never get it?

It's got to be injected.

(25) WHen To Eat Salt, Salt In Bath
[2006],[Attendee]

You said not to, but I wondered why

[Aajonus]

The only time, like I said in the book, the only times that I suggest people eat salt if they have adrenal exhaustion?

There's another situation, let's say somebody has gone into intensive vomiting and diarrhea and they're not holding anything down and they're starting to lose weight and they're starting to lose consciousness then I would use salt in a situation like that to help bring them back.

And I would use salt in a mixture with whey to help bring them back to bring the electrolytes and the salts back into the body instead of using Pedialyte or something like that.

Gatorade, that's what they do in hospitals.

Gatorade You give Gatorade to a patient.

Hello?

[Attendee]

What would be the proportions of salt and whey?

[Aajonus]

Oh, it would be just a pinch, about a 1/8th of a teaspoon to about a quart of whey?

[Attendee]

Why do you put the salt in the bath.

[Aajonus]

Well, it helps draw the toxic salts out of the body from years of eating table salt?

Dries the skin a little bit, but you put the milk in with it, so it doesn't do that.

So, with the milk, the salt and the vinegar in there, it's not going to cause that.

[Attendee #2]

It's great for injuries.

I used to race Moto and Durham on the street a lot and every time I hit the pave, I'd get road rash.

I'd get some salt suck it right out, heal the wound 3x faster

Might even try for what's going on with you.

[Aajonus]

No, I don't want to do it cause it will stop it and I don't want to stop it.

I want all the chemicals, all that AZT out of my body, it's the whole reason I did it, so I'm not gonna stop it.

[Attendee]

Why would it stop it.

By pulling it out a bit faster?

[Aajonus]

No, no, no?

When it starts mixing with the skin then the skin changes its whole ability to release, so I found that it stops detoxification, not helps implement if you put it directly on.

Getting in bath water it's diluted enough; it'll help pull it out of your system and I do that.

I get into a hot tub several times a day, if at all.

He said put it right on it.

I put 2 tablespoons of salt and 3 - 4 tablespoons of vinegar and 1.

5 - 2 cups of milk.
