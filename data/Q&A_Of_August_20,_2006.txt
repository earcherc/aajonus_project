(1) Aajonus Doesnt Eat Chicken While Travelling, Eggs and Chicken Fed Soy, Non Orgnaic Chicken
[2006],[Aajonus]

Fowl is the thing that I don't touch when I travel, unless it's in an Asian country and they're poor

[Attendee]

Why.

[Aajonus]

Because commercial chickens are mostly fed soy as a protein source and even though they say it's organic, the soy was raised organically, in order to feed chicken, soy, you have to process it and use a chemical treatment?

Otherwise, raw soy kills any bird, all poultry.

Just like raw soy will kill a human, so it has to be solvent and heat treated, so it's a highly processed food, so I don't eat chickens that are fed a lot of soy, nor eggs from chickens that are fed a lot of soy.

If it's over 25% - 30% soy, I don't touch the eggs or the chicken.

That's why I don't eat birds.

Well, I know I can call those people right away.

That's not a problem.

I can find out.

If it doesn't say organic, that's what I'll buy.

It says organic, I won't buy the eggs.

For eggs, I'd use just the opposite, non-organic, because they're lying.

They're saying that those chickens are organic by feeding them the organically raised soy.

They're not feeding them organically grown soy.

They're not feeding them the organic soy in its form that it was produced organically.

It's a chemical treated product, so it's a lie.

It's not only a misnomer, it's a lie.

[Attendee #2]

So, buy eggs that don't say organic.

[Aajonus]

Because everyone that's organic will be feeding it 75% - 80% soy and those that don't feed it organic are feeding it 25% - 35% soy?

[Attendee #2]

What are the other people feeding them.

[Aajonus]

They feed corn and other grains, animal food products?

And that's what they should do.

My farmers who I get my eggs from feed them rotten meat cuz chickens are scavengers, that's what they eat.

They like rotten meat.

[Attendee #2]

You said that James was getting a new source today.

[Aajonus]

We've got a new source?

He feeds them no soy.

, We don't buy Lilies anymore.

Lilies is still better, they only feed there's 25% soy, but we've got a better source now.

[Attendee #2]

What place.

[Aajonus]

James won't gimme the name, nor the the place?

.

(2) Aajonus Puts Chlorine Off
[2006],[Attendee]

Chlorine and such

[Aajonus]

Drinking Gerolsteiner, Perrier, any one of those, San Pellegrino, any of those naturally sparkling waters will help get rid of the chloroform vapor that results from chlorine.

But if you want to be really tricky, like me, when I go to a hotel and I want to use their swimming pool, I'll sneak into their their pump room and turn off the chlorination and I'll take a few grapefruits and juice them and then pour that into the swimming pool that evening, and I'll be able to swim the next day.

But then I can only do that for three days before they start noticing the algae starting to turn green everywhere.

[Attendee]

So, rotten chicken at theaters, grapefruit at pools.

(3) Autism Levels Tested In Amish, Secret Socieities Poisoning People, Depopulation, Politicans Own Pharmaceutical Stocks
(4) Bird Flu, Bacteria, Parasites, Virus, Vaccines
[2006],[Aajonus]

Bird flu

It's the most ridiculous thing in the world.

There's bird flu, but bird flu is a virus.

Virus you cannot communicate, virus is a soap.

They're not alive.

Virus are protein bodies that cause the dissembling of structure.

So, if your body cannot use bacteria or parasites or fungus to disassemble some particular structure of the body, cellular structure or other tissue structure, even fluid structures, then the cells themselves will manufacture a virus, a solvent, to break that down and disintegrate it.

Now, the virus come into play when the body is too toxic.

If the body's too toxic, let's say with mercury or lead, arsenic, could be even too high in sodium, from salts or iodine.

If the bacteria eats the degenerative: tissue, parasites, bacteria, or fungus, it destroys those bodies.

It destroys the bacteria, the fungus, or the parasite, so that they cannot maintain that a normal environment of being our janitors.

The body will make its own soaps, which are virus, to dissolve that tissue and to remove it from the system.

That is the least desirable of any cleansing, but it still is a detoxification, a cleansing.

Normally a parasite will eat degenerative tissue or dead tissue, and they can eat a 100x their weight in 24 hours and they'll excrete only about 1% - 5%.

So, it's like if we ate 100 pounds of food, and had a one pound feces the next day.

The body has very little to decontaminate.

Instead of having 100%, it has 1% to decontaminate it with the help of the parasites.

Bacteria, it can eat about 50x it's weight in 24 hours and it excretes anywhere from 5% - 10%.

So, still the waste is incredibly reduced.

If we ate seven pounds of food in a day, we'd have about a pound excrement the next day.

So, if you compare us to parasites and, and bacteria, you see that the ratio of help of decontamination, of reducing the waste product is pretty immense.

So, parasites are very favorable if you know how to take care of yourself.

If you don't and your body has to use the solvents, the virus to help you cleanse, the problem is just like if you go to use a solvent to clean the grease off of your carport or driveway or garage, what happens.

You take a large amount of fluid, you put a degreaser down and you mop it up, you clean it, and then what do you have remaining?

You have about two and a half gallons of toxic waste?

The human body does the same thing.

Your body has to use a lot of fluids to utilize the virus properly, to break the tissue down, to dissolve it, and when it disassembles and makes it diluted like that, it contaminates the whole body.

For example, if you look at spinal meningitis and cerebral meningitis, if it's bacterial, the doctors don't worry about it.

If it's viral, the doctors panic about it because it causes tremendous swelling and seizures and paralysis.

So, a virus passing from a bird to a human is an absurdity.

Cells in your body make virus.

You can make a human virus, you can't make a bird virus.

[Attendee]

Then why don't they test it.

Why do they say it is the same virus?

[Aajonus]

Because it's all a hoax?

They're getting ready to sell a vaccine for $7 billion.

It's all about money.

I'm gonna send an email in my next Primal Diet newsletter.

I will show you the documentation where the FDA is putting an office in every country because you have to understand that every country looks to United States science as the most advanced and most respectable and authoritative.

So, these other countries aren't doing any tests.

Those people who are showing up in Asia to do these tests, are volunteers for the pharmaceutical industry.

They have nothing to do with the health departments.

The FDA's connections with the pharmaceutical industry go back 30 years.

The last 11 heads of the FDA went on to be executives with a pharmaceutical company.

The tie is immense, so it's all about selling a bird flu.

You remember the swine flu in the 70s.

They were blaming a swine flu?

You know the pig flu.

Everybody was going to get it?

President Ford went on and took the the swine flu shot right on tv.

Who was our vice president.

Rockefeller?

What does Rockefeller own.

Five pharmaceutical houses?

We bought $7 billion of swine flu.

Thankfully, here in San Diego we had two people who were very interested and got the word out.

Ida Honoraf was a consumer advocate and she was syndicated at about 180 major radio stations.

And she talked about all the bad things and the good things for the consumer, whether it was food and she predominantly went on food.

But whether it was car industry products, no matter what it was.

So, she was a very well respected woman and Dr.

McBean from San Diego got together with Ida Honoraf and they filed suit against the FDA, the surgeon General, the president and the vice president about this swine flu and said, you watch, you give this swine flu to people and people are gonna start dropping dead.

So ,since Ida Honoraf had all that publicity that syndicate, every newspaper listened to her.

So they were right there on the administrative lines when the swine flu was being given.

The first two weeks, 2,300 people died within two and a half days of receiving the swine flu as a direct result of having the swine flu, they shut the whole program down and guess who has 7 billion of swine flu in the vaults.

That's right, we do and we pay for the storage of it?

Guess what's coming out of the Avion flu relabeled.

The swine flu vaccine is being relabeled as Avion, and we're gonna pay $8 billion for it this time because that's what Bush said he's going to do?

I investigated the plants where they said they were going to produce it.

None of them could produce it in the time slot that they said they could.

There's no way, unless it was already a made substance and the only only flu vaccine in the vaults is that one that has that quantity.

So, it's very obvious what they're going to do.

They don't like paying about probably $13 million dollars a year to store that swine flu, taking up all that space, so they want to get rid of it.

They're not gonna lose money on it.

They said everybody's gonna get the swine flu, nobody got it.

You have to understand a virus is not alive, doesn't live.

If they spray a solvent in the air, you're not going to breathe, it's not gonna hold up very well.

[Attendee]

But they can give it to use in the jab.

[Aajonus]

If they inject it in you, yes?

[Attendee]

But no other way.

[Aajonus]

Right?

But I mean, if they make a virus, what they are giving you, it's a breed.

If they cause a virus to be manufactured that was manufactured from a bird, you will have the Avian flu because you're injecting it into.

Just like if you get polio vaccine, you're getting polio from a money because they breed the polio virus, or they make the polio virus by infecting monkey tissue.

Then they separate that, they sterilize it, purify it, mix the thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum with it.

Those are just three of the nasty contaminants and they put that in there and they inject it in you.

So yes, you can get a flu, but it has to be injected in you.

That's the only way you can get a foreign flu.

[Attendee]

Because some of it was given by the mouth.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, the salt vaccine.

But your body was able to break that up, but there was lots of disease caused by the salt vaccine.

[Attendee]

So, you don't believe there's gonna be a pandemic.

[Aajonus]

You can't have a pandemic of flu, it's impossible?

Cells can't make it like that.

All of your vaccines are a hoax, every one of them.

There's no evidence, and you'll notice every time they come out with a vaccine, the disease is already gone.

Cause they know if they produce the vaccine and give you the vaccine while the disease is still in it's growth factor.

.

Anyway, while it's still on the rise, they will never give any kind of a vaccine, because the vaccine will cause the disease to be worse and it'll kill a lot of people.

So, they always wait till the disease is almost gone.

If you look at the records on whooping cough, smallpox, any of those, when those were so-called pandemics at the time, they were all gone.

They were down to almost the 1% level before the vaccines came out.

It's money, it's all about money.

It has nothing to do with health.

Vaccines are the worst thing you can do to anybody in your life, especially children.

And they blame fish for all the mercury.

In one vaccine, there have been 67,000 trillion molecules of mercury.

Do you know how much fish you would have to eat.

Let's say, swordfish?

You'd have to eat about 1 million pounds of swordfish in your lifetime to get what you get in two vaccines of mercury.

So again, the medical profession and the government is trying to move the people's minds out of suing the pharmaceutical houses and the government for requiring governments for requiring vaccines because of all the mercury contamination from vaccines.

And, in California, there's 68 vaccines required by the time the child is 15.

5 years old.

In some states it's 120 vaccines by the time they reach that age.

(5) Brain Used Metallic Minerals, Cooked Food Turns To Free Radiclas
[2006],[Aajonus]

The brain uses the most metallic minerals because metallic minerals are used to convey electricity and light, and that's the method of the nervous system

That's its object, to transport information, sensation, stimulation, all through electrical and electricity, and light.

That's dependent upon metallic minerals.

Metallic minerals need very little to do that.

However, when you cook a food, you cause the metallic minerals in it to be free radical.

So, whether it's mercury, lead, iron, cadmium, any of the heavy metals, once it is a free radical, that means that it has no way of knowing its place in structure.

And when you cook, you destroy enzymes and vitamins and everything that makes the basic structure of where that element is used.

So, since the brain and nervous system use most metallic minerals, If your body can't discard it and get rid of it because it doesn't have the fats to do it, or the proteins and the elements to make the enzymes to escort it out of the body or perspire it out or discharge it out the mucus membranes or the feces or the urine to get rid of it some way, it stores in the nervous system and brain.

The brain detoxifies mainly through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands and the eyes.

So, if that's discharging like that, if it's discharging out the tear ducts and it goes through the eyeball itself, it's going to create macular degeneration.

.

(6) Cardboard For Radiation
[2006],[Aajonus]

Yeah, but he's supposed to be putting cardboard between that and the food

[Attendee]

No, he does not.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

Then you call him and you say you have to put cardboard between.

Cause I tell him he has to.

Don't allow it.

He doesn't do it to me because I don't allow it.

I say, you put a cardboard between that and my food.

Don't you dare put that next to my food.

You've gotta have a piece of cardboard or something between.

.

(7) Century Eggs
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, rotten eggs are good

The Chinese and the Asian, they have their century eggs, 25 years old rotten eggs.

They're very expensive and they're very good.

[Attendee]

They don't go bad.

[Aajonus]

Just remember any raw food never goes bad: it just ages, it molds, the earth digests it in different ways, whether it's predigested with molds, soil bacteria, whatever it does?

Now, the Chinese, when they do their century eggs, they bury them in different kinds of soil.

Some are black and some are white, so the molds that get inside predigest all the protein and the fats.

So, that like when these old oxygenarians eat the century egg, may pay $1000 for a 25 year old egg.

He can have an orgasm two times a day for 28 days, and it's worth it to him, that's his Viagra.

He'll pay $1000 for one of those eggs because every molecule of that protein is completely fractionated.

So, every particle of protein and fat can be completely absorbed and utilized in the human body.

You take them by closing your eyes, putting a nose clip on your nose, and you eat them.

I've eaten them.

Gave me too much energy.

I couldn't handle them.

I'll eat rotten eggs, but not those, those are too much.

I'll be a sex fiend, even.

[Attendee],[Aajonus],[Attendee]

I wonder why we don't see too many girlfriends for too long

Laughs

Every summer we've had a problem where the eggs when I get 'em.

They turn black inside.

[Aajonus]

Those are good.

[Attendee]

Those you want.

They're already predigested?

[Attendee]

All right.

Oh God.

[Aajonus]

You've got a mold in there that's predigested.

[Attendee]

I just had hard time.

[Aajonus]

If you close your nose to them, it'll just taste like an overly salted hard boiled egg.

[Attendee]

Oh, this wasn't hard, it was mushy.

[Aajonus]

I know, but that's what it tastes like, an overly salted, hard boiled egg.

As long as your nose is closed.

[Attendee #2]

Mine tastes slightly like chocolate.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, there's some that will.

bolting.

[Attendee #2]

But it taste slightly salty.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's a different kind of mold.

That's from salmonella, that's a good salmonella bacteria.

.

(8) Coconut Water Bloating
[2006],[Aajonus]

Water in it anymore cause it causes bloating

I was wondering why all these Asians don't drink this coconut water, they just break it and throw it away.

And I was having 4 of those a day and after a month I started getting ankle and feet swelling.

.

And that's why they don't, cause it causes swelling.

It takes a lot more time to drain the water out, it takes a lot of time in the process of making coconut cream.

.

(9) Eating Humans
(10) Ecoli To Dissolve Brain Tumors
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, once you put the water over the egg, all of the reproduction of the cell stops instantly

[Attendee]

What if I just wanna wash and eat.

[Aajonus]

Well, that's okay, but I mean, the fecal matter is supposed to be good for you.

All animals eat fecal matter, except for humans.

All animals every day eat fecal matter and dirt every day.

And like I said, I quoted in the book from the University of Toronto, they've been using e coli to completely shrink and dissolve human brain tumors in 2 - 5 days.

But there's no money in it.

[Attendee]

No, they charge $10,000 in injection.

[Aajonus]

No, that's salmonella?

See, they haven't even marketed it.

They've marketed only bacteria for that cancer treatment and that's the through Yale University.

They attenuated the salmonella, so that normally the salmonella will go in to stop and the flow of oxygen to a tumor and then will start eating up the tumor.

They attenuated, so the salmonella will not eat the tumor, just stop the oxygen inflow and outflow from the tumor.

Then they inject $12,000 of solvent into your tumor to dissolve it, which is highly toxic.

So, instead of you just rotting your eggs and letting salmonella grow and eating it, they want you to spend $20,000.

$8,000 for an injection of the attenuated salmonella, then $12,000 for an injection of the toxins to dissolve the tumor.

.

(11) Essential Oils, Coconut Oil Winderness Family Naturals
[2006],[Aajonus]

I think they're very toxic and very dangerous optimally

Now, the average person out there is eating very bad oils that are processed at very high temperatures.

So, if you're using Young's oils, they're distilled at 270°.

That's lower than any other oil, so it's better oil for the person who doesn't get good oil, but it's still not a good oil because once an oil is distilled, a cell does not have a choice to absorb it or not.

It penetrates the cell, so the cell has no option and it destroys and damages lungs and mucus membranes, all kinds of things.

And you see the people I've seen who use those essential oils a lot are ultra sensitive to everything.

Oh, they become very sensitive and irritable.

Well, you can use the coconut oil from wildernessfamilynaturals.

[no longer good, it's heated to a higher temperature] and it's called the Filipino fermented coconut oil.

It took me six months to talk that fellow into lowering the temperature to 96°.

So, he makes it a 96°.

It's never taken over 96°.

Well, anytime you're putting another oil in it, you're putting a manufactured distilled and usually solvent treated oil that has to meet the FDA's regulation for purity.

The best thing to do is just use the coconut oil, it smells wonderful.

Smells like coconut.

Ginger juice, you can put in, like I put in the Primal Facial Body Care Cream.

Just put a few drops in the oil.

I found a new, I found a new lip gloss treatment.

What you do is take about six ounces of the honey, the thicker honeys like the sage, and you put one teaspoon to one tablespoon of coconut cream in it, so it's slightly creamy, and you rub that on your lips and it tastes very good.

Especially after it's set for about a day and it completely relieves any wrinkling, it helps hydrate the lips and the so-called dehydration that you normally feel in the lips will disappear for almost 24 hours.

.

(12) Fat In Thailand
[2006],[Aajonus]

Absolutely

When I'm in Thailand, I'll go to these markets where all the flies are all over everything, and that's the stuff I want, and they'll hang it there with this strips of fat.

You'll never find this in our market.

You've got a strip of of meat here and it's about 1/3 or 1/4 meat and the rest is all this fat.

And they look at this white boy,and I'll say, I'll say in English, cause I don't know the Thai words for the fat yet, and I don't know why I haven't learned it, but I haven't.

And I'll say, "The fat", and then they'll cut off the fat and gimme the meat and I'll say, "No, no, no.

I don't want the meat.

I want the fat".

And they think I'm crazy because most white people just don't want any fat on anything.

And it's dirt cheap.

I paid for five pounds of good fat and with a little meat.

I paid like $5 for 2.

5 kilos.

So, that's about seven pounds.

.

(13) FDA Corruption
[2006],[Aajonus]

The FDA is putting an office in every country, because you have to understand that every country looks to United States science as the most advanced and most respectable and authoritative

So, these other countries aren't doing any tests.

The Americans bring their, and it's those people who are showing up in Asia to do these tests are volunteers for the pharmaceutical industry.

They have nothing to do with the health departments.

The FDA's connections with the pharmaceutical industry go back 30 years.

The last 11 heads of the FDA went on to be executives with the pharmaceutical company.

The tie is immense, so it's all about selling a bird flu.

.

(14) Finding Eggs, Free Range &cage Free
[2006],[Aajonus]

I would go to a health food store and pick the worst option there

It wouldn't say vegetarian fed and it wouldn't say organic.

[Attendee]

Probably the cheapest.

[Aajonus]

Probably?

Trader Joe's goes off and on with who they buy from, so you have to keep up with who they're buying from and what those chickens are fed.

Range free.

But range doesn't mean- that's all garbage language again, it's a misnomer.

They can put 'em in a room like your kitchen and call that range free.

Range means they're allowed to roam, that doesn't mean on a range like we normally think of a range, just means that they have a range of space.

A range of space.

[Attendee]

With another thousand chickens.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, and they could be not touching sunlight, not out in the wild at all or on cement floor, that's free range or cage free, it's the same thing.

If you say pastured, that's different.

They have to be on grass, they have to be on dirt.

Pasture raised are the best, pastured eggs.

.

(15) Goji Berries
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, goji berries are a berry that's produced on a bush

They're said to have properties to reverse quite a few diseases.

And in my research in the tribes who use them, cultures who use them, yes, they had a lot of medicinal properties as long as they were either dried in the sun and eaten or juiced fresh.

But any time if it were steeped or cooked in any way, it reduced the efficacy by 60%.

When it's processed like for distribution in our commercial when it has the FDA's approval of sanitary, it's effective in maybe 10% - 12% of the people.

So, if you're going to eat goji berries, get them dried, sun dried, or the powder and steep it in some water, but sun steep it so it's soaks in the water, some other way to utilize them other than cooking and processing.

.

(16) Government Overreach, Getting Food In The Future
[2006],[Aajonus]

I think it's very eminent, I think in about seven years it's definitely going to be

We have our network of food connection and these people own the farms, so we're protected We're protected for a while, for about seven years.

Probably about seven years we'll get by, but after that, I don't know.

Either we change or the government.

Thailand, Cambodia, Laos; very poor countries they have very little interest in.

Laos is probably the least available to because there's not enough people who live there.

There's not a lot of population to enslave, Cambodia's the same way.

Thailand's got a lot of people, that's why they're infiltrating them.

Thailand's been in cahoots with the US government since the Vietnam War, heavily.

That King knows that if he doesn't do what those bankers say and the people who run the US government, he won't have a land, he won't have a kingdom.

So, he lets them in and he lets them do too much.

[Attendee]

Which country is that.

[Aajonus]

Thailand?

There are organic seeds, that's not true.

There are about 23 companies that have heirloom seeds.

You go on the internet and you find 23 to 26 companies.

The big companies are still trying to buy them all out, but they're not selling.

They bought up over somewhere around 2000- when I last read 2,700 of those seed companies, Dow and Monsanto.

There's only 23 - 27 left in this country.

Like I say, you have to have a close network with a farm, you have to be in farm country.

You'll have to go up north in California if you're in California, or you have to go east anywhere to Pennsylvania and then beyond Pennsylvania.

Well, in Virginiam there's a lot of Amish and Mennonites all through the south.

There are lots of farm.

There's not a lot that's not owned by Dow, Monsanto, and Warners, and what's that other big agricultural company.

They own most of the agricultural land now?

[Attendee]

Archer Daniels.

[Aajonus]

No, they own crops, but not as much farmland, but that's a company that is getting heavily into it?

.

(17) Hot Water Bottle, Brain Swelling
[2006],[Aajonus]

Okay, so let's say you are lying on one side, you put the hot water bottle here, you put a towel, a small hand towel that goes over that and over both eyes

Leave your nose or mouth out so you can breathe and that'll maintain the heat just in that localized area of the head and eye.

It'll cause the heat to go in so all the muscles in the eye and then the head, everywhere will relaxed.

More blood and neurological fluid and lymph can go into that area to clean the area and to bring more nutrients into the area, so you can ensure better reversal of the macular degeneration and the prevention and healing of it by that.

But a raw diet, I mean a good raw diet with raw meat and lots of raw fat is the only way I know that you're going to actually be able to reverse it and stop it or stop it and then reverse it.

Well, you can do it every night.

[Attendee]

I'm sorry.

Can you go over that again.

[Aajonus]

You place it near that, just not against, It can be right near, right barely touching?

[Attendee]

Because the hollow.

You could have it?

[Aajonus]

No, you don't want it touching at all?

You don't want touching your skin.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

They're not touching the eye, but touching the-

Not even touching your head.

You want it on the pillow or bed right beside you, not touching your body.

Only thing that'll touch your body is that towel that goes over your head.

[Attendee]

How long.

[Aajonus]

You're gonna move sometimes away from it during the night?

So.

you could be there for a half an hour, you could be there for two hours or five hours.

Your body will move away when it wants to, if it feels the increase in circulation is getting too large.

Let's say you have some cirrhosed tissue in the brain and if you have too much swelling in the brain, you could have an aneurysm and you could have a blood vessel burst in the vein, you better believe your body's not gonna allow you to stay there around the hot water bottles for very long.

You're gonna move in your sleep away from it, unless your body's completely stupid.

[Attendee]

What does that have to do with bursting a blood vessel.

[Aajonus]

Heat causes increased circulation, that causes swelling everywhere?

You've got it here, it's gonna cause swelling in the brain, goes back into the eye all the way into the brain.

If you have too much swelling in the brain and you have cirrhosed tissue in the brain, dried areas, the circulation could cause a fracture of a blood vessel.

Your body will move away from it, unless you live on donuts and you're a police officer.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]

Laughs

It depends, if it's moving from your brain out your eyelids, yes.

If it's moving from your tear ducts, then it's moving from the eye itself.

You could do an analysis, it will cost you $2,300.

I can give you the laboratory.

[Attendee]

But have you had good results of people that have done this.

[Aajonus]

For the ones who will do it?

The ones that do that practice, it helps quicker.

[Attendee]

An actual reversal.

[Aajonus]

No, it's a reversal?

Well, it goes into cessation first, and then reversal.

[Attendee]

Can you see it on the iridology.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, I can?

Well, I can see macular degeneration in the tissue from the pupil.

You put it here and you can put pressure up into your temple, it's not what you want.

You want everything to be open for even flow of nutrients.

Cuz you could cause a certain area to blister and bubble, bruise it.

So, you don't wanna put it directly on, ever.

Same thing in the ear, you just lie on your back and you have it here or here.

Not a towel.

Well, you can put a towel in between, a towel over.

Like if you had a hot water bottle here, you're lying back on your back and you've got the hot water bottle sitting right bottle sitting right next to your ear, you could drape a towel over this and your head over the hot water bottle on your head, and that'll keep the heat directly into your head area, your area.

[Attendee]

And that's the same thing for the neck.

Don't put it.

[Aajonus]

Correct, I do not put it on my neck?

You do not put it on your neck.

I say that in the book, never put it against your skin.

You put pressure there, it's gonna block the circulation you're trying to flow.

It could make it worse.

I said put it next to your head and put the towel over.

You can if you like, dampen it.

in a hot, oh, sorry.

I just thank you.

You can get into a hot bath or a hot room, but that affects the whole area.

Then you're dispersing all the nutrients that you've digested in a certain amount of time to a whole area, that doesn't concentrate on a troubled area.

To concentrate on a troubled area, which you want to clean and heal quickly you have to focus the heat to that area.

.

(18) How Much Vegetable Juic Per Day
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, it depends upon the individual

Anywhere up to 4 cups a day, but as little as 1 cup a day.

Depending upon the size of individual, 8 oz- 16 oz, or even 4 oz - 16 oz at a time.

Sometimes I've had people that are 300 pounds and I tell 'em to drink a whole 24 oz first thing in the morning.

But the first juice, first juice for that person would be 24.

Then the next one could be 12, next one could be 8, and then after that 8.

Depends upon the individual.

[Attendee]

Why can't you do wheat grass.

[Aajonus]

No?

It causes over alkalinity in the intestines and acidity in the blood, it turns the blood to acidic.

Wheatgrass juice is not a beneficial juice if you're on this diet.

If you're a vegetarian, you need that acidity in your blood cuz you won't reproduce red blood cells.

So, if you're a vegetarian or fruitarian, wheat grass can help you.

But if you eat any kind of meat, any kind of dairy, then you shouldn't be eating wheatgrass juice.

[unclear] and parsley.

Those are good green vegetables, leafy vegetables to get uoi chlorophyl and vitamin E.

.

(19) Inflammatory Breast Cancer, Vegetable Oils
[2006],[Attendee]

Different kinds of breast cancer and what you do about it

[Aajonus]

A cancer cell is normally a cell that will form into a tumorous area around dead cells, and it'll form some kind of fibroid tissue?

If the body decides that it doesn't want to build dead tissues into a fibroid tumor, it can start producing a serum or a bacteria, a solvent, a virus, or a bacteria to dissolve it right where it exists, and then that causes an inflammatory situation that's not localized to a tumor.

The whole breast can be involved and that often happens if the lymph system is complete completely failing, and that's getting more and more these days.

The more vegetable oils people eat, the more congested the lymphatic system is.

Animal fats do not create hardening of the arteries and heart disease.

All the tribes who eat nothing but cooked meats and cooked animal products have no heart disease and no arterial sclerosis.

People who eat cooked vegetables have arterial sclerosis.

Vegetable oils in the human body, harden and crystallize over time.

We do not have the body temperature of an herbivore, n animal that eats vegetation.

They have a body temperature of 101° - 105°.

Ours is 98.

6° or lower, and most often lower.

So, when we eat vegetable oils, especially hydrogenated, which means it's turned into plastic molecule, same molecular structure as plastic.

We take those in the body, they harden in the body.

They dehydrate the area that they're contained in, and that means if it's part of the cell, the whole cell wall would become hardened.

And what do you have.

Cirrhosed tissue, hardening of the artery, hardening of the heart?

We had very little heart disease when people were eating lard and bacon and stuff like that.

Now that everybody's eating margarine and vegetable oil, heart disease is the number one killer.

.

(20) Juicer, Green Power Gold, Mature Vs Yougn Coconuts
[2006],[Aajonus]

That's a very vinegary, very fermented one, and it'll cause lots of detox

If you want to eat it, go for it.

Oh, you're not talking about vegetable juice.

I thought you said vegetable juice?

Meat okay.

You let it go for two months, you just have to start opening it again.

Still use it.

You have to start over.

That machine is a juicer that's this big and they use it in Thailand and all throughout Asia to make coconut cream.

So, I bought the machine that you can take the hard shell off of a coconut in three seconds, plus a machine that takes the meat and grates it.

You put that into the juicer, you can produce like 20 gallons of coconut cream an hour.

I got it for a particular individual, he already paid me for it and it's been sitting there for six months unused.

That's right.

James has been sitting on it for six months, so I told him if he doesn't get it in action with, then by the time I go back to Thailand, I'm buying another set and I'm going to produce it.

[Attendee]

Locally.

[Aajonus]

Locally, absolutely?

[Attendee]

So, we'll have someone running up and getting.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

You probably won't charge as much as James.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends, I'm not going produce it myself?

I'm not going to do the work, I'm gonna hire people to do it and that means getting a location to do it too.

So, whatever that costs is what it would be.

Well, if you want to really produce it's better to go for the Green Power Gold machine.

No, immature coconuts will not give you coconut cream, that's just gel and water.

It's gotta be the thick meat inside, the white thick meat.

Those are young coconuts, those aren't mature coconuts.

[Attendee #2]

No, no.

That's the husk that you see around it.

Inside, when you break it open, the white thick, that is the meat.

There's some that are jelly, which is the one you're talking about.

The jelly is okay to eat, but what he's talking about is a thick, tougher meat that coconut flakes are made from.

It's a thick and it's tough to chew.

That is what we're making the coconut cream from.

[Aajonus]

And it's completely oval, it's not that coned edge, that's all young coconut.

Well, the trick there is you go to a Spanish community area, they buy them frequently, but when you're in a white bred area, you never gonna get a good coconut, cuz they just don't eat enough of them.

They've been over there on the shelf a long time.

.

(21) Lymph Baths, Only 2 Days A Week
[2006],[Attendee]

Stimulating your lymph system

[Aajonus]

In the book, We Want To Live, the primal diet, the expanded version, under lymphatic congestion?

I tell you how to do the lymphatic baths.

But only take them two days a week max.

Never closer than three days apart because the amount of detoxification that'll occur, you could not keep up with.

It could cause you tremendous amount of fatigue, fibromyalgia, all kinds of problem.

In the lymphatic baths, you stay in there anywhere from an hour - an hour and a half.

[Attendee]

But you said if I needed another bath at a shorter time.

[Aajonus]

Up to 20 minutes, you could have 100x 20 minute baths a day if you want.

But if you're going to do a forced lymphatic detoxification, that's anywhere from an hour - an hour and a half bath, and that's forced.

That will force many things to dissolve in the lymphatic system, that'll melt all of that hardened vegetable oil that's clogged the arterial system and heart, in layers.

And when that starts exuding.

Your body has to get it out of the body quickly and the nutrients that are available are going to be limited.

So, if you get too much out too frequently, you're going to be chronically fatigue and in fibromyalgia, you're gonna ache everywhere.

[Attendee #2]

What about a hot tub.

[Aajonus]

The same as the hot bath?

[Attendee]

As long it's not chlorine.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

As long as it's not chlorine.

[Attendee #3]

I can't last more than 20 minutes.

I can't do it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

That's how toxic your lymph system is.

.

(22) Macular Degeneration, Eyewash, Mercury In Eyedrops
[2006],[Aajonus]

That's a difficult one because macular degeneration is eyes, it's in the eyes, it's muscles in the eye

Macular degeneration is when the eye tissue is breaking down.

That usually comes from the brain dumping its heavy metals out the tear ducts or somebody using an eyewash or a contact cleanser that has thimerosal, liquid mercury in it.

Always some toxin causes the breakdown of tissue, and it's always an industrial toxin.

Only 10% of the diseases that exist today existed before industrial pollution.

That means probably that cooked food attributed 10% of all the diseases exist today.

The other 90% have come from waste products and the products of industrial manufacturing.

The brain uses the most metallic minerals because metallic minerals are used to convey electricity and light and that's the method of the nervous system.

That's its object to transport information, sensation, stimulation, all through electrical and electricity and light.

That's dependent upon metallic minerals.

Metallic minerals need very little to do that.

However, when you cook a food, you cause the metallic minerals in it to be free radical.

So, whether it's mercury, lead, iron, cadmium, any of the heavy metals, once it is a free radical, that means that it has no way of knowing its place in structure.

And when you cook, you destroy enzymes and vitamins and everything that makes the basic structure of where that element is used.

So, since the brain and nervous system use most metallic minerals, if your body can't discard it and get rid of it because it doesn't have the fats to do it, or the proteins and the elements to make the enzymes to escort it out of the body or perspire it out or discharge it out the mucus membranes or the feces or the urine to get rid of it some way, it stores in the nervous system and brain.

The brain detoxifies mainly through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary gland and the eyes.

So, if it's discharging out the tear ducts and it goes through the eyeball itself, it's going to create macular degeneration.

If you're washing your eyes with a wash for contacts or because your eyes get dry or red and you're using an eye wash that has thimerosal in it, it's liquid mercury.

You're going to keep absorbing the mercury into the eyeball, and eventually it's going to damage your eyesight, young or old.

And if it gets deeply into the eye, into the muscles of the eye, it'll cause macular degeneration.

How to reverse macular degeneration is very difficult because the circulation in the eyeball is very narrow.

So, you have to have swollen eyes, and that's not comfortable to have, it blocks vision, and that's the only way you can quicken circulation and nutrients in the eyeball to help remove damaged tissue and to regenerate it.

So, it's difficult, but you could do it at night.

One night, lie on one side and put the hot water bottles near your eye, not against it, cuz you don't wanna put pressure there.

You want the heat to go to the area to cause swelling.

Swelling is nothing other than increased circulation.

Anytime you get an injury and you have swelling, do not run for the ice.

If you do, you're gonna cause blood clotting, you're gonna cause the damaged, bruised tissue to remain in the area and that's why your athletes burn out in the late thirties.

Because they've collected too much scar tissue and their injuries because their coach wanted them to play, so they put ice packs on them, so they can get out there and play again.

Cuz as long as their is swelling there, the joints don't work as easily, so they're likely to fall out so they can't play well.

So, they pack ice on their legs and knees, the arm the elbow, wherever it is.

And then these people end up with scar tissue and not able to work past their 30s or 40s years old because all the accumulation of scar tissues.

So, do not use ice ever, unless it's just for a minute or two just to reverse some pain.

[Attendee]

What about if you have burnt your hand quickly, just one bit on it.

[Aajonus]

If you burnt it, well that's different?

I'm talking about an injury, a bruise and that kind of swelling.

But if you burn something, applying an opposite time, which is a few seconds or a minute of ice to that area, will actually reverse the burn in some situations.

So, that is the only time that I would ever use ice is on a burn and it has to be immediate, immediately after the burn.

10 minutes after a burn, it doesn't work anymore.

It's too late.

All the fluids have changed.

[Attendee]

Can you apply aloe.

[Aajonus]

No, to reverse a burn, it has to be the ice immediately to stop it?

An ice cube straight on the burn, but it has to be within three minutes in most cases, in children, five minutes.

[Attendee #2]

Ice packs and got freezer burn on my arm.

[Aajonus]

Well, they have a fluid which maintains the ability to stay cold longer, it's a chemical.

[Attendee #2]

I believe ice would not have done that.

[Aajonus]

No, it wouldn't have done that.

I mean, leaving it on a while is gonna create a frostbite.

But that's different.

It's usually radioactively involved.

It's like you have certain substance, you can microwave it or heat it or freeze it, and it'll stay frozen longer and quicker.

It's in the gel.

.

(23) Meat While Travelling
[2006],[Aajonus]

Take your butter, take your cheese, and take your honey

[Attendee]

And we can live on those.

[Aajonus]

No?

You can get eggs anywhere, you can get meat anywhere.

[Attendee]

They took my butter at the airport.

[Aajonus]

Well, where did you land.

[Attendee]

I was in Rome?

[Aajonus]

Oh, well, Italy's not gonna let you go in with agriculture.

I guess if you wanna put it in your luggage X-ray, but you can ask them to handle it differently.

You go to the airline officials and ask them to have it hand checked.

[Attendee]

Can you use a doctors note.

[Aajonus]

But that doesn't mean that they honor it all the time?

You don't know until you do it.

[Attendee #2]

Dairy's always the hardest, milk especially.

Everything is processed.

So, what staple can you buy that's universal.

[Aajonus]

Best thing to do is go get avocados, eggs, meat and fatty meats?

Just get lots of fatty meats.

Ask them for the fat cuz they cut off fat all the time and they just throw it away.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah, so when I'm buying meat now I want the fatty meat.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

[Attendee]

How do you swallow it.

[Attendee #2]

I bought a meat grinder?

I grind up all my meat.

[Attendee]

Maybe with honey would go down better.

.

(24) Melanoma
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, melanomas can come from a lot of different irritations to the skin

First you have to look at cancer.

Cancer is a collection of dead cells.

You've lost the ability to have parasites or bacteria or a fungus to dissolve the dead cells, so dead cells will then begin collect.

Now that is where tumors form, collection of dead cells.

If it's benign, there's no cancer cells.

If your body says, I want a chance to get rid of this tumor quickly, it'll make it into cancer, so I prefer cancer over a benign tumor.

Just the opposite of medical profession because a cancer cell, when it dies, it lets out a solvent, identical to viruses that dissolves all the surrounding dead cells of the tumor.

So, you can have tumor dissolve in two days to two years.

If you have a benign tumor, it can take 30 years to dissolve it cuz there's no blood vessels in it.

There's no dead cell that have a solvent property about them, like cancer cells.

So, your body has to eat away at it from the outside in slowly and gradually.

But when you have vessels going through a tumor, a malignant tumor, you have all those cancer cells and blood cells, so you can dissolve and eliminate it immediately.

For itchy skin.

Well, it, it depends what your itchy skin is from.

If your itchy skin is from a lack of fats, the sun can cause an irritation to the cells, rupture them, kill a lot of them, and cause melanoma to form, another melanoma can be formed from your body throwing, let's say mercury or aluminum or combination of, of aluminum and formaldehyde from vaccines, throwing it out from an injection and store it in your tissue somewhere and it comes out through the skin and dries it.

That usually creates a hide that turns into a crust and then can turn into melanoma.

So, there are several varieties of melanoma nd it depends on what yours is from, or the person about whom you're speaking.

It depends on what is in them that they have to detoxify.

Could be heavy metals, could be just a lack of fat, good raw fat, that lubricates their skin.

If the sun created melanoma, every black person in the world would be dead because of all the sun that they get.

All the Asians that work in the fields, all the Mexicans who work in the fields, all the Latins who work in the fields that are subjected in the sun all day long, they'd all have melanoma, but it's rare.

Rare in them because they all eat some kind of fat; avocados or whatever it is, they eat some kind of raw fat that feeds the skin.

.

(25) Mucus, Allergies, Pollen
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, a lot of that's misconstrued as allergy

Just have to remember, you have mucus to block particles that you breathe in that normally aren't part of food and they don't digest properly, pollution from, let's say a diesel truck, is not something that the body normally takes in.

The body can take pollens in, it can take organic matter and make it into food as part of the body locally.

Our skin eats all the time.

If you get particles in your mucus membranes that the body cannot break down and utilize in the system as food, then it will create mucus, excessive mucus to allow it to flow outward.

And so it's an allergy in a sense, but our allergies, our oversensitivity to the natural pollens, which nobody should be allergic to have a reaction because we have too many industrial toxins stored in the tissue, which prevents certain enzymes from being formed to break a pollen down into a substance that could be food locally into that mucus membrane.

So, it's like taking antibiotics.

You take antibiotics, you lose your intestinal flora and bacteria, you can't digest your normal food anymore.

So, when we breathe in these toxins: lead, dioxins; whatever they are, and they line our mucus membranes and get into our tissue and we get normal things that come into the system like pollen or dirt.

Dirt is fine, everybody eats dirt.

All animals eat dirt.

But if we breathe it in with these toxins, we can't break it down properly, we can't utilize it properly.

So, it becomes a problem in our system, so of course we flow with mucus to discharge it.

And mucus is mainly to protect, to allow things not to enter the mucus membranes without proper slow decomposition and utilization and absorption in the system.

It is now because we're so toxic and polluted, it's now a element of discharge, of excrement or secretion to get rid of toxins.

If you can't break it down, if you can't break those elements down, you want a runny nose.

If you don't have a runny nose, those elements get into your tissues and they'll cause cirrhosed tissue, a hardening of your mucus membranes, which leads to cirrhosis or cirrhosis tissue.

I don't know why they only refer to cirrhosis of the liver, but you have cirrhosis in all MS, that's multiple sclerosis.

Cirrhosis tissue means hardened tissue, so it can apply to anything.

So, cirrhosis could be of anything, but they only apply it for some reason to liver.

I know quite a few people, especially Asians, who don't have any sense of smell or sense of taste because they've used the American medical system's way of Dristan sulfur products that dry out their sinuses.

Can you imagine going through life not able to taste or smell.

Everything is like cardboard?

Everything you taste, no flavor to it, no smell, no fragrance.

That's quite a loss in life.

So, allow the mucus to discharge, just say, well, that's part of my being.

Now.

I will go through life blowing my nose and having mucus discharge.

Of course, if you go on a good.

Such as this one, your chances are 95% that will only happen for so many years.

The people who've gotten on this diet with emphysema, asthma, allergies, they're all through it by 6.

5 years, never happens to them again.

If they come in with the allergies and not emphysema, usually two and a half years, they may only have a short occurrence of it at the heaviest bee pollen season.

So, it may last 10 days, two weeks at the most, and it's usually a 10th of what they suffered before, so they have no problem with it.

Then after about 6.

5 years, then there's no problem.

People with emphysema, takes 6 years to get to the point where it's reduced.

.

(26) Never Use Ice, Only Immediately After Burn
[2006],[Aajonus]

Swelling is nothing other than increased circulation

Anytime you get an injury and you have swelling, do not run for the ice.

If you do, you're gonna cause blood clotting, you're gonna cause the damaged, bruised tissue to remain in the area and that's why your athletes burn out in the late thirties.

Because they've collected too much scar tissue and their injuries because their coach wanted them to play, so they put ice packs on them, so they can get out there and play again.

Cuz as long as their is swelling there, the joints don't work as easily, so they're likely to fall out so they can't play well.

So, they pack ice on their legs and knees, the arm the elbow, wherever it is.

And then these people end up with scar tissue and not able to work past their 30s or 40s years old .

(27) No Vaccines, Bacteria Wont Make You Sick
[2006],[Attendee]

I have a friend whose mother didn't give him and his brother any vaccinations

They were born in the late 40s, early 50s, and there was the worst sewage spill ever in the San Diego River and went out and went all the way down to to Point Loma Coastline and the surf was perfect.

And my friend who had never had a vaccine, so nobody else would go out in the water.

He was surfing perfect surf by himself for like two weeks.

He knew he was fine.

He knew he could.

He knew he knew his immune system was good.

His mother got put in jail for prescribing carrot juice as a remedy in the 30s.

They put her in jail in New York for a day.

So Derek for re For For her prescribing.

For prescribing, yeah.

Prescribing.

But yeah.

Coli story.

Yeah.

This guy swimming.

[Aajonus]

Well, let me give you an example.

There was a movie out in 1986 I believe it was called Latino, and it starred Robert Beltron and one of my patients, Tony Plana, he was the third lead, and it was about our interference in Nicaragua under the Reagan and Bush bodies and how we shouldn't have been there and what we were doing to Nicaragua cause it was a very democratic society.

And he was gonna shoot a movie down there.

Just before he left they gave him a legal page sheet that said, do not eat anything raw.

If you an apple, you steam it.

If you have water, you boil it.

When you're in the swamp shooting, you don't touch your mouth or your face without washing your hands with a heavy detergent first.

Don't drink any water near a swamp, unless it's recently boiled or distilled.

They had this long list of everything not to do and Tony said, what do you think.

I said, do absolutely the opposite what it says: you drink the swamp water, you eat your meat raw?

You eat everything raw and you'll be okay.

So, they were down there shooting and within the first eight weeks everybody got deathly ill except Tony.

Robert Beltran if you see the movie, if you can rent it, you see him lose 50 pounds from one scene to another.

He got so ill that he lost 50 pounds.

They shut the film down for six weeks he got so Ill.

The only person who you didn't get sick was Tony Blunt.

The entire set, everybody, the director, the actors, the gaffers, all of the cast and, and technicians, all of them, the entire crew got sick except him and he was drinking the swamp water, he was eating the raw meats, he was doing everything.

that a.

Hadn't been on on that raw giant.

[Attendee]

A normal person who wasn't on a raw diet, they would've got sick anyway.

[Aajonus]

They might have had a little case of it?

But if they're eating only cooked and processed and boiled foods, they have no enzymes and vitamins to help them get well.

So, here these people were sick and continuing to eat all this processed, cooked food and eating nothing raw.

So, they weren't getting any enzymes, no vitamins from their food.

So, they just got sicker and sicker and sicker.

.

(28) Only Domesticated Animals Get Cancer
[2006],[Aajonus]

Do you know that no animals have cancer except domesticated animals

No cancer out there because they eat dirt, they eat feces all the time?

They even lick eachothers.

They do all the time.

And people are afraid of e coli, e coli is completely responsible for the final digestion of protein.

That is the protein that feeds the nervous system in brain.

It's the finite particles that can get into the ultra small axons and ganglion interactions in the brain and nervous system.

Without e coli, your brain and nervous system would not exist in the stage it is.

You'd be a plant.

[Attendee]

25 years ago when I was in school, they taught that e coli was an essential part of your bacterial colony.

Now they don't teach that anymore.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

They're telling everybody to be afraid of it.

.

(29) Polio Vaccine
polio vaccines flu

(30) Preserving Food
[2006],[Aajonus]

For Y2k

Yep.

Everybody was panicking.

I was a programmer, an autistic programmer, when I was autistic I was a programmer, so I knew that there was no danger in all of that.

Bbut a lot of people were freaking out, so I was experimenting ways to preserve food.

A friend of mine shot a deer and I bled it and skinned it and butchered it, and we put it in different containers with different things: olive oil, peanut oil, kefer, buttermilk, all kinds of things.

Every one of 'em preserved very well.

I've still got some of that meat that sits in those jars that's just as red and as pretty as when I put it in those jars and six years ago.

So, if you want to do that, you collect it.

Honey's a very good substance to have a lot of on hand, and I keep about five gallons, I keep five gallons in my, cupboard.

I don't keep the same one.

I keep rotating eating them, but I always have five gallons in my cupboard, so I've got all that raw meat in jars and it's not even in the refrigerator.

[Attendee]

None of them worked better than the other.

They all worked equally?

[Aajonus]

They all worked just as equally, as long as you don't open the lid?

Once oxygen gets into it, the bacteria grow.

There was a scientist that, Vladimir Steffenson, who worked for the government, studied the Eskimo.

He quoted a scientist who kept a piece of steak fresh for 10 years using buttermilk, covered it in a jar, 10 years that meat was fresh, so it could have been longer than that.

They just opened it after 10 years.

They have, they have a tendency to mold.

They get blue cheese mold on them.

I've tried it everyway and I can't get butter to maintain, unless it's refrigerated.

Well, cheese does not have to be refrigerated, just dehydrates so much.

Cheese molds in the refrigerator.

Cheese will not grow and not mold outside of the refrigerator, cheese depends upon low temperature molds.

That's why they put cheese in cold storages and in caves to get those molds to grow in the cheese to make the cheese.

You can't make cheese without a mold, without some kind of a fungus.

In Asia, a native taught me how to preserve meat fat.

She took duck fat, chicken fat, beef fat, and she would just take it and just put it out in the sun for an hour and it creates a plastic ceiling, just not really plastic, but it's just like plastic and it seals the fat.

So, I shared something with her that was a year old and it was delicious under no refrigeration.

But you just bake it in the sun for an hour and it puts a ceiling over the fat.

[Attendee]

And then what do you do in.

[Aajonus]

Well, yeah, well she had it in a cooler, but you know, just out of the sun?

There was no ice in it.

I would put it in glass of course, a gallon glass jar.

.

(31) Raw Fats Are Better
[2006],[Aajonus]

Absolutely

Raw is better, definitely, because even your cooked fats are going to dry out and harden in the human body a little bit, but even in cooked they will stay mostly liquid in the human body, but vegetables do not, they turn into crystals.

Every time you have a little sore and a crystal comes out a little yellow or amber looking little thing that comes off, you look at it under a microscope and you'll find crystals all throughout this little thing that comes out of your pore, that's vegetable oil, hardened vegetable oil that your body has thrown off.

.

(32) Red Meat Activity Rings
(33) Science Of The Diet
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, the science behind the diet is that it works

Like I said, in the beginning of the revision, everything that's in that book came about from experience.

In other words, everything in there is empirical.

Anything I say with science to back it up was following what actually happened because that's the way I started from back in 1973 when I realized that everybody contradicted everybody else about health.

So nothing was good for you and nothing was bad for you, and basically everything was confusion.

I realized that I wasn't going to accept anything as truth, unless I saw it work and that's when I began observing and just taking notes, observing and taking notes.

And I did not even start writing this book until 1993, cuz I wanted to have a lot of years of experience to see what really worked and what didn't.

(34) Skin Indigestible, Eating Bones, Kosher Bad, Pre Prepated Meats Are Cooked
[2006],[Aajonus]

It's not going to lodged in your throat

When the animals get bones and people get bones lodged in their throat, it's always cooked bones.

It's like the difference between unfired clay and fired clay.

You can chew bones, the Eskimos do it every day.

They chew bones.

My teeth aren't good enough, after the chemo and radiation, all my teeth dangled and rotted all the bone around.

I mean, I can rip meat up and I can eat hard stuff, but when it comes to the bone, I'm not gonna chance on breaking my bone and teeth.

[Attendee]

If you had something to pulverize it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's what I mean?

Pulverize is good.

[Attendee]

Grate it.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, you can grate it?

I do that sometimes.

It's a lot of work.

[Ron]

Well, I was kind rolling into everything you were talking about traveling.

What you consume while travelling and how to shop.

I didn't know about the fats, but it can't be cured fat.

[Aajonus]

If it's cured, like kosher?

There's salt in it.

Heavily salted.

So nothing kosher.

[Ron]

When you're travelling, how do you know what they do.

[Aajonus]

All you do is ask?

[Ron]

Corned beef.

[Aajonus]

Corned beef is always cooked and processed?

Any pre-prepared meats are always cooked, they're blanched they call it.

Half cooked, it's like half baked laughs.

.

(35) Wheat Grass Acidic In Digestive Tractalkalin In Blood
[2006],[Attendee]

About wheatgrass

[Aajonus]

Yes, I did?

In the first book.

I say that wheatgrass juice, unlike any other vegetable that is green and produces chlorophyl, is acidic in the blood and alkaline in the intestines.

And you want just the opposite of that.

You want acidity in the digestive tract and alkalinity in the blood.

Your blood always should be on the acid side, but we have so many toxins in our body that the blood has a tendency to get over acidic.

That's why I suggest vegetable juices throughout the day to help balance that so nobody gets too irritable or too dry or whichever comes first, the dryness or the irritability.

(36) Where To Bu Yfresh Coconuts
[2006],[Attendee]

You just return them; they'll take them back

I return everything.

I don't keep anything.

[Aajonus]

If I get a bad coconut, it goes back to the store.

Absolutely.

[Attendee]

Better do what she does.

She throws them up in the air and smashes them on the ground.

[Attendee #2]

What I do is I put em in an old towel and take a hammer and then I take a wide screwdriver, get in there and just pop it the meat.

[Attendee #3]

I found a good way to do it quickly.

I've got a wooden board, a really hard board and a serrated knife and I slice it thinly.

[Aajonus]

I found out an even better way.

You take the oyster knife like I say, and pull out the coconut, then you just chop it into large chunks and you put it in a food processor like a Cuisinart, and you grate it, put it into gratings.

But before you do that, once you take your pieces, your chunks, you put 'em in a jar, like a quart jar or larger, half gallon or gallon jars.

You fill your sink with hot water, you put it in there, you put a little water in there, and you get the pieces of meat wet, and then you let us sit.

You've got no level of water in the jar, you've just got your wet coconut in an empty jar, floating in this warm, it heats the coconut.

You get almost 1/3 more coconut cream.

I had three little coconuts this big and I got (4x) 8z jars of the coconut cream by doing that.

Four eight-ounce jars from three little bitty coconuts.

[Attendee]

Explain that again one more time.

[Aajonus]

Okay.

You take the coconut; I don't drink the water in it anymore cause it causes bloating.

I was wondering why all these Asians don't drink this coconut water.

They just break it and throw it away and I was having four of those a day and after a month I started getting ankle and feet swelling and leg swelling.

And that's why they don't, cause it causes swelling.

[Attendee]

You used to tell me to drink the coconut water.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

But you were just drinking one a day, there wasn't much.

But it takes a lot more time to drain the water out.

Takes a lot of time in the process of making coconut cream.

So, what I do is now I just skip that and I just go out there and I take it on a big rock out in my backyard, slam it on there and break it under pieces, then take my curved end oyster knife, pries it very quickly out of the coconut shell.

Then I slice it into chunks, no chunks bigger than that, that square, of course, it's that thick.

Then I put those into a gallon jar.

If I'm doing just a few of them, I'll put it in a quart jar.

But if I'm doing a lot of them and I want to make it for weeks at a time, like 5 -6 weeks, I may be doing 10 coconuts.

So I'll put two gallon jars of this coconut meat.

I let it sit in the sink full of hot water.

Not hot enough to burn my hand, but hot enough and it takes about 15 minutes to heat that coconut.

And I'll go do something else during that time.

[Attendee]

What is the temperature of the water.

[Aajonus]

Probably 105° - 106°, somewhere around there?

And then I come back and everything's warm inside, the heat has caused all of that oil and the meat to become warm and soft.

I get it a little wet before I put it in the jar, I forgot to say that.

I wet it with my gerolsteiner cause I don't buy any other water.

[Attendee]

You could wet it with the coconut water.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, you could wet it with the coconut water, absolutely?

[Attendee]

Tablespoon per coconut.

[Aajonus]

Tablespoon of what?

[Attendee]

Water?

[Aajonus]

Well, I just, I have a bowl there and I just dip it all in there and put it in the jar.

Listen to me.

I have water in a bowl and I take the pieces and I dip them in the water and put 'em into the jar, then I immerse it.

[Attendee #2]

Warm water.

[Aajonus]

So, then after the coconut is warm, I put it in the food processor, my Cuisinart, and it gets grated, so it's grated coconut.

Then I juice that and it gets so much more juice, there's no chance of cracking the juicer at all, and there's no strain on it.

It moves through faster.

And I get 1/3 more coconut cream.

(37) Whey Protein and How Much Sex Aajonus Has
[2006],[Aajonus]

Well, whey is good to get rid of fibromyalgia, it helps break down urea in the body

It contains a lot of lactic acids, so if you have sore joints, if you're an athlete, you get sore long, bruised long.

The whey, that's the liquid if you take milk and it separates to curds and way, it's the yellow stuff that's left.

Dried whey, it's a big seller, pumps up muscles.

It inflates them, then you'll look like Arnold Schwarzenegger does today.

[Attendee]

He looks very flat.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah.

Did you see his skin in that last bathing suit shot.

His skin looks like an old, tired elephant all the way down?

I'm older than he is, and I don't have any of that.

And I don't exercise, he still exercising.

[Attendee]

How do you do it.

How do you keep muscles on your arm if you don't exercise?

[Aajonus]

I eat properly.

[Attendee]

But it doesn't put muscle on.

[Aajonus]

Oh, it does.

It does if you've been on the diet as long as I have.

[Attendee #2]

Laughs he said he had a big sex drive; you don't see his girlfriend.

What does he do with all of it.

[Aajonus]

I have three girlfriends in Thailand, that's the only time I have sex?

2 - 3 months a year.

No, not at the same time.

That's too much work.

[Attendees],[Attendee]

Laughs

For the whey, does it have to be refrigerated or can it be out and should it be out to be fermented.

[Aajonus]

It depends on, when you leave it out, it gets more vinegarette and sometimes it's harder to drink, it's a little bit more acidic?

So, it's up to you how you like it.

[Attendee]

Can you add honey to it.

[Aajonus]

If you add honey to it, it might rush into your system a little too quickly?

[Attendee]

Okay.

And how much per day.

[Aajonus]

It depends upon the person and the amount of soreness and aching?

[Attendee]

But when he talked about pickles, do you recommend that.

[Aajonus]

That's one way to pickle instead of vinegar?

I prefer that to vinegar for pickling, but it just doesn't taste the same.

[Attendee]

Seasickness.

[Aajonus]

Airsickness, Seasickness.

The best way to do it, get something like a piece of wood and put it under a band and hold it there.

For some reason, that stops it.

Couple of years ago, I had a Vietnamese girlfriend and we were flying for a vacation and it was her first time on a plane, and she was vomiting as soon as the plane left the field, so I just took both of her wrists and I put my finger across like this on both of her wrists, instantly the nausea stopped, instantly just like that.

It was only a 45-minute flight, so I held her wrists the whole time and that took care of her

No, I didn't join the Mile High Club.

[Attendee]

Where did you learn this.

[Aajonus]

Well, I was on a boat and seasick as hell?

A friend of mine had a small boat, and we went out in off the coast to go fishing for some swordfish.

And I don't do well on the ocean on small boats, all of that makes me terribly ill.

So, he had these little wristbands that had a little wooden band across it and attached on, nausea stopped like that.

[Attendee]

It hits all your acupuncture points as they cross it.

[Aajonus]

And I don't know how it works and why it works.

It just works.

It's like everything else in my book.

I can give you bullshit reasons from science why it works, but it works.
