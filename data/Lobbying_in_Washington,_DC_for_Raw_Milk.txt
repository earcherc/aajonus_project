I and two volunteers Jeff Slay and Lindsey Jacob will educate Senators and House of Representatives from July 15 through August 1, 2007. At sometime we will email you a request or two to fax your Senators and House Representatives about the raw-milk issue, giving your testimonial about benefits of raw milk and asking them to reopen our state boarders to allow raw dairy to pass from state to state. See the end of this newsletter to send donations to help us. Thank you! There was never any legislated federal law that raw milk could not pass state lines but Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order (EO) outlawing it. Reagan was a friend of industry and an enemy of the people. He broke the unions and wrote many EO’s that continue to damage the public’s health.
