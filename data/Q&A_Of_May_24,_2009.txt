(1) Aajonus Ate Mad Cow Disease
[2009],[Aajonus]

I ate Carrefour supermarkets when I was in Paris for 3

5 years and that was that maw cow meat.

I don't have a problem.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]

Laughs

And I started eating that in 1993 - 1996 and they said it's a 10 - 15-year incubation period.

Y

ou have to eat the brain and nervous system to have that kind of toxicity from mad cow, so you eat the muscle meat and you'll be pretty assured of being okay.

.

(2) Aajonus Clinic, Volcanoes In Phillipines
[2009],[Attendee]

What are you going to do with your clinic

You talk about this clinic several times?

What are they going to do there.

[Aajonus]   I will mainly have locals, at least 50% of the clientele will be local that don't pay, that just work part of the land in exchange for my help?

And we will grow all the foods, all herbs, everything that the people will use to get well.

So, let's say people have cancer and they wanna go to someplace other than Hippocrates that starves them to death.

They'll be able to go to a place where they can get nourished and get stronger and healthier.

[Attendee]   So, you will raise the cow.

[Aajonus]   Everything?

I've already made a deal with the government in Palawan Island.

They have a dairy experimental farm and it's going under because Filipinos aren't used to milk, so I'm buying their cows and their milking machine and there's the portable ones attach on it, hook up.

It isn't like a big tank or anything.

So, I'm getting three cows that are imported from New Zealand and I'll start with that.

I'm putting it all together, hopefully in July or August, one of the other, l'll put it all together and have everything finalized.

[Attendee #2]   The island that you found that had the indigenous people.

[Aajonus]   No, no, no?

That was almost 2000 miles away.

Oh.

The reason I chose Palawan Island because all the other islands are in the volcano district.

You've got the Ring of Fire, it goes all the way from Japan, all the way down to the the lowest island, South Island of the Philippines.

There are 47 volcanoes in the Philippines.

And they're like this.

If you look at the map, you've got Manila with the big island, Luong here and then you've got all these other bigger islands spread all the way down till you get to Menal, the biggest island.

And then over here you've got Palawan Island, which is a very long island.

Now all of these islands are in that big crevice that's 20 times the size of the Grand Canyon and all these volcanoes underneath it.

So, if that goes off, Japan, all of that's going under.

But Palawan is an island that's on the shallowest sea floor of anywhere, only that island.

[Attendee]   Won't you get like tidal waves from that.

[Aajonus]   No, because I'll be 1900 feet up in the mountains, they're selling me the mountain top?

That's why I'm up there.

(4) Aids, Swine Flue, Vaccines
[2006],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

I think you had a radio interview and as part of the interview you'd talked-

About the radio interview on swine flu

[Attendee]

Yes.

And as part of that interview, I think you one of the topics was aids and I think you said the development of AIDS took place at UCLA.

I got from the article that you were saying that the only way that you could get aids was by injection or vaccination.

[Aajonus]

Correct or blood.

Or a transfusion contaminated blood.

[Attendee]

So, you don't really, it's not really a sexually transmitted disease.

[Aajonus]

Impossible?

In my laboratory experiments, I've only found, let's say two bodies of congested so-called virus of AIDS.

Virus is not contagious in the first place.

You have to have a chemical injected in you, just like swine flu.

There's no way for you to get swine flu, impossible.

Swine flu means that you have pig tissue inside of your body that your body is using a solvent, not a bacteria, not a parasite, not a fungus to break that tissue down.

Now, even if you had pig tissue in you from inhaling pig tissue, let's say you worked on a pig farm and it was a toxic pig farm where the pigs had a lot of dandruff and you inhaled it regularly, you would end up with a flu to break down the swine tissue, still is not the same as the swine flu.

The swine who makes a solvent to dissolve its own tissue is different from ours.

So, it's still not the same flu that a pig would get to clean its own tissue.

So, you cannot get AIDS unless it's injected.

And if you read Horowitz's stuff, you see they put it in the Hepatitis B vaccine to give it to people in the states.

They put it in the smallpox vaccine in Africa, 125 million donated by the US government and the British government.

Why.

They took over 27 countries in Africa?

How did they do that.

They went in and said, oh, you've got a disease?

We gave you these free- ur government's not gonna give freeway anything, unless there's something attached to it.

So, the British and the American government gave 125 million shots of vaccine to Africa for free and paid for them to be injected into the Africans.

Paid for all the doctors and nurses to do that.

Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.

It was estimated about 2 billion to do.

What did they get.

They went into the country and said, Oh, you've got an AIDS problem?

We have drugs and they pulled AZT out of the vaults.

AZT is the chemo they gave me.

AZT was found a year after it was given to me to be so toxic for humans, they were no longer given to humans, so they put it in the vaults.

When the AIDS came out, they said, AZT is good for aids.

No tests, no nothing.

They just wanted to pull it out of the vault to kill everybody who had aids.

So, they took the, the AZT also over to Africa and they killed everybody that they could.

And so, what happened was they went to government and said, "Oh, we'll give you this medical help, we'll give you this chemotherapy, we'll treat your people", killed them, put 'em in debt.

Debt that they could never repay.

So, now the World Bank runs for the British and American governments runs those 27 countries and if you read a book called, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man", then you'll understand that's what they do, the governments do.

It's a way of waging war and take over resources without having to really send people in to fight, you poison 'em to death.

[Attendee]

What's the name of that book again, confessions of what.

[Aajonus]

Confessions of A Financial Hitman?

[Attendee]

Can you just say one more time and exactly what is it they put in the vaccine.

Likes Aids, it's not some sort of virus?

[Aajonus]

Well, what they did was, according to Strecker, who found it was created at UCLA in 1961 and 1962, they claimed that they had produced it from the lymphomic virus of the sheep and the waste products and the leukemic virus of a bovine, cow

So, they took those two toxic substances, put them together, and then put it in the hepatitis and the small pox vaccine.

[Attendee]

So, virus isn't a bacteria or anything.

[Aajonus]

No, it's not alive, it's a chemical?

And the chemicals that they put in there allowed the chemicals to infiltrate the RNA and DNA chains and damage them.

That's a biochemical electromagnetic science that the military is very keen on.

[Attendee]

So, that's what aids is.

Destruction of RNA, DNA?

[Aajonus]

Chains, yes?

Breaks down the system.

[Attendee]

I've talked to a shaman in Africa, and he said that they, they're people would make these marks on their arm as if they had vaccination, so they would avoid it.

[Aajonus]

Poisoning.

[Attendee]

Not poisoning, but they actually even accessed some kind of a soul DNA in a way that actually altered their capacity for consciousness.

He was not gonna let his people.

[Aajonus]

Right.

Well, Vietnam, when they started vaccinating the children, the adults, the ones who were like shamans and there were a lot of shamans in South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the elders would come out and cut their arm off up the shoulder because they knew the poison was gonna go back and do damage in the body.

They preferred to cut the arm off, they could see what was going to happen.

Even better to cut the arm off, then to let that poison circulate to the system.

And then, the American medical profession, these barbarians.

Instead of the medical provision being the barbarians for injecting these poisons, the grandparents became the savages for cutting off the arm.

But they could see what, of course, the Americans are not able to see at all.

.

(5) Allergie, Low Mucus
[2009],[Attendee]

Family member has been on the diet for a while and they have severe allergy to dust mites

What do you recommend.

[Aajonus]

That's a low mucus?

Like I said, if you look at mucus under a microscope, it's like a bunch of s like a bunch of material put together, layers of material.

If the fibers are tight, nothing's going to get through and it can be as much 20 layers thick when you're dumping mucus or it could be as small as three layers thick.

If the fibers are open, if you don't have enough protein fibers.

All of those dust and the mites will just get right through that mesh and right in irritate the mucus membrane.

And that's an issue, it's a problem.

[Attendee]

What do you do.

[Aajonus]

So, they need to build mucus?

Milkshakes are your best.

Milk and eggs together with little honey, extra cream.

Helps build mucus fast.

.

(6) Big Gut, Aajonus Weight
[2009],[Aajonus]

If you're asking me, I say, no, you don't want to get rid of it

I kept mine for 23 years.

[Attendee]

Flat now.

[Aajonus]

Now, yes.

But for 23 years I kept it, it's like a baby.

A baby's not gonna grow and get healthy fast unless it has that gut.

You notice that all babies who have no gut, their bones grow thin and feeble.

You want a baby to be fat, you have to be fat cause you're on a new diet.

You're growing yourself anew, you have to consider yourself a baby.

So, you need all those extra nutrients to be able to distribute them.

If you run into a detox, what's gonna happen if you don't have the excess nutrients.

You're gonna fall and crash hard?

[Attendee]

This is the only place the fat is, right here.

[Aajonus]

That's good.

But it goes from there to the rest of your body if you just keep eating.

And I say that in my books.

Get fat.

[Attendee]

Thank you very much, Aajonus laughs.

[Aajonus]

You know I'm still fat 18.

Last night I was 18.

7% body fat.

Athletes who are my size are like 9% - 12% body fat.

But when the fat molecules are very tiny, like when they're raw, they don't take up much space.

But when you cook a fat, it swells anywhere from 5 - 50 times its normal size.

So, you have all this bloating from all this old fat, and I've been on this diet eating all raw foods and no cooked fats since 1972, February of 1972.

So, I don't have any of those toxic fats in my body anymore.

All of the molecules of fat are small so I can stay and still be fat.

But I wish I had had more fat on me when this happened cuz I would've gotten to this quicker and easier cuz my body got poisoned.

[Attendee]

Did you lose muscle mass too.

You look like you lost muscle mass?

[Aajonus]

I lost everywhere.

I lost muscle and fat.

So, I'm down to like a 29-inch waist, which I haven't has since I was 16.

.

(7) Butter and Cilantro For Mecrury
[2009],[Aajonus]

You can take it all day long and it's not gonna change the color of your hair

You have to give rid of the aluminum first.

[Attendee]

I read somewhere that you said to do like a tablespoon of cilantro juice with a tablespoon of butter or something every two hours to get rid of mercury.

[Aajonus]

It'll help?

[Attendee]

Would that help him to do something like that.

[Aajonus]

Well, depends?

If it's just mercury, I'd have to look in his eyes to see what kind of metals are coming outta his skin.

He could have a fungus involved with it.

He could have that tetracycline or something like that because that looks like it's an antibiotic irritated along with the metals.

So, he is got a fungus in the skull too.

[Attendee]

And the only time it ever went away was when we used to have a swimming pool and it was chlorine, it was years ago.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, killed the fungus.

[Attendee]

It would go away in the summer when he was in a pool all the time.

[Aajonus]

But you can put vinegar on it, it will help destroy it too.

But to keep your head strong, to get it to be able to withstand that kind of toxicity, the bone marrow would be good.

So, one day you could put vinegar, diluted vinegar by 50%, rub it in into the scalp, and then just let it sit for a day, and then the next day, rinse it out and then put bone marrow in and let that sit for a day.

[Attendee]

Put on the bone marrow even if it's old.

[Aajonus]

Even if it's old, it works wonderfully?

Go around stinking Zinc can create some hair coloring loss, but it doesn't cause.

.

.

.

(8) Clay To Absorb Toxins, Types Of Clay
[2009],[Aajonus]

17 or something, or 1890 something

I forgot the dates completely, but I remember the story.

He advertised that he's gonna drink a 1/2 cup of arsenic and they publicized it.

He made a ton of money and only on his deathbed did he give the secret away cause he pulled the stunt several times.

He drank a half a cup of clay an hour before he drank- or 40 minutes, something like that before he drank the arsenic, so the clay absorbed it.

[Attendee]

What kind of clay.

[Aajonus]

They didn't say, I like to stay away from any clay that's from molten lava because you've got a lot of molten metals?

Your minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium or alkanalizing ones, when they reach volcanic temperatures, they go off into a gas, so they're no longer part of that rock.

And when the algae in water starts eating- algae and mossy rock, and all plants eat rock.

So, when the water mixes in the plants, whether it's algae, whatever, breaks those down into a clay, it's still a toxic laden clay.

It's a clay that I won't eat.

[Attendee]

Which one would you eat.

[Aajonus]

Well, Terramin clay is the best?

It's from an old aqua bead.

.

(9) Collodial Silver
[2009],[Attendee]

So, what's the hoax with the colloidal silver

[Aajonus]

Colloidal silver are minerals, plants eat minerals, we don't?

If we eat metallic minerals, what's gonna happen.

It's gonna become free radicals in the body, they do a lot of damage?

Of course, you'll feel better because you're poisoning the blood so badly, it's not gonna detox anything old.

It's just gonna handle that toxicity in the blood, that's how medication works.

You poison the blood and the intestinal tract, so all the body does concentrate on those two systems, the blood and the intestinal tract.

All of your symptoms go away.

All of your other symptoms go away, so you think you're well but you're not.

[Attendee]

So, it's just pushed deeper.

[Aajonus]

Pushed deeper, and you're causing more toxicity because now you're not gonna be able to digest properly, cuz you've destroyed the bacteria in intestines?

90% of all functions of the body happen with bacteria.

90% of all functions in the body are by bacteria.

You destroy them when you take an antibiotic, you're destroying a myriad of bacteria all over the body: in the blood and the lymph, and the intestinal tract and the heart, brain, everywhere.

Mass contamination.

So what happens.

You don't assimilate your nutrients, you don't heal properly, you scar and you get many more poisons deep into the tissue?

.

(10) Cows Vs Goats
[2009],[Aajonus]

If you're overweight, I prefer goat milk

If you have a sugar problem or diabetes, prefer goat milk.

But if you are not any of those four things, then cows milk is better.

Have you ever seen a calm goat.

It doesn't happen?

So, their milk has adrenaline precursors in it, so you can't get fat on goat's milk.

.

(11) Dairy
[2009],[Aajonus]

And the reasoning is

[Attendee]

And the reasoning is that if you were in the wild, you wouldn't really have a cow to milk?

[Aajonus]

Oh, yeah.

There are many nomads that would capture a lactating animal and milk them?

That's how they started doing it in the first place, especially the Norwegians.

You know, they didn't wanna like live like the Eskimos and have to eat icicles all the time, the meat with icicles.

Cause when you're fishing in a portal in the in, you've got ice foot and a half thick.

By the time your fish comes out of there in your mouth, it's a popsicle already.

So, the Norwegians started importing cows and buffalo, buffalos had larger utters, into the Norwegian regions and started milking them.

[Attendee #2]

And the Mongolians.

[Aajonus]

Mongolians did, Indians in India, heavy dairy country?

They're vegetarians, but they're dairy eaters.

Our mouth is predominantly bacteria.

We have more bacteria than any other animal on the planet, including dogs and cats.

Dogs and cats have 16 - 118 bacteria parts per million of saliva.

We have 2300 - 2600 bacteria per million parts.

[Attendee #2]

Never want to kiss anybody anymore.

[Aajonus]

You're just giving them some good bacteria.

So, we infiltrate our food with bacteria first.

The hydrochloric acid just breaks apart larger food particles, so the bacteria can get in and eat and digest them.

[Attendee]

I guess one of the arguments that I've heard is, you know, well, no other species drink milk or some species.

[Aajonus]

Have you ever offered any other animal milk.

I've given it to horses?

I've even milked a cow given it its own milk, and they'll drink gallon, gallon and a half in one sitting.

Every animal that I've ever offered, herbivore or whatever, has all consumed milk.

It's just that how many females are gonna let 'em milk them.

Have you seen there's pictures on the internet where they have the tiger nursing monkey babies and animal baby?

[Attendee]

Babies, but adults, that's what I was wondering about?

[Aajonus]

All animals, every animal, even squirrels drink milk and eat cheese.

I feed mine all the time.

Eating butter and getting the butter into your skin and sunshine is the best vitamin D source.

.

(12) Dandelion Citric Acid
[2009],[Aajonus]

If you're after that particular effect of that particular herb

[Attendee]

Like dandelion might be your liver?

[Aajonus]

Well, dandelion is very high in vitamin C, so it helps the citric acid cycle of utilizing fats fuel, so it could give you more energy?

There's different things that you can do with dandelion.

Some people take it to clean the liver and the blood.

I can't say necessarily does that, but the vitamin C is very good for oxidizing fats to be able to use as fuel for energy.

[Attendee]

We should be able to get everything we need without all those.

[Aajonus]

No, I'm saying they're all good if you can get them organic, and juice them and fresh?

[Attendee]

We have clover in our yard, fresh, organic clover grass.

We wondering if we could juice it.

[Aajonus]

Out of your yard.

Doesn't matter, you've got chemtrails galore and you had all those fires that sent you into a tizzy and a lot of people into a tizzy?

So, all those burned, um, home products that burned up in the homes, which were highly toxic, radioactive.

Everything's in the soil.

Going on for years now, that'll go on for 10 years.

[Attendee]

It's all coming off my roof.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Should hose that and get it all down right away.

You're breathing that a little at a time.

[Attendee #2]

How do you know then that you get from somebody who doesn't have the same issue.

[Attendee]

Yeah, everywhere's toxic now?

[Aajonus]

Not unless you follow up and say, give me the name of the producer and then you call the distributor.

Then the distributor will give you the producer's name and then you go through these channels, I've done it.

[Attendee]

Is anywhere not toxic now.

Everywhere's got toxins the air now?

[Aajonus]

It's true, but I wouldn't trust anything around here.

In fact, I stopped buying avocados from down here for the last year since that fire.

[Attendee #2]

Where did you get them from.

[Aajonus]

⁠The lower part of Fresno Santa and Santa Maria area?

[Attendee #3]

So, that goes for the organic farmers that are local here.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

[Attendee]

I mean, that's what we're all eating.

[Attendee #2]

They're also being watered with the fluoride water too.

[Aajonus]

Yep.

.

(13) Depleted Soils
[2009],[Attendee]

If our soil is depleted, then what's the best way to get minerals in our diet

[Aajonus]

Vegetarians have come up with this concept, because they can't be healthy as vegetarians, so they're making excuses?

There is no soil that's depleted, unless peanuts or legumes are grown in the soil like soy.

Those grounds are completely depleted, but not in minerals, but of proteins and microbes.

Never get depleted in minerals, it's impossible.

[Attendee]

Wasn't that the whole idea of that when the Nile with flood and everything, and it would have such plentiful crops as a result of all the minerals that came.

[Aajonus]

Well, the algae breaks down rock, provides all those minerals?

So, when the algae would flow over there, they would have all these digested minerals and they would break down into the soil.

[Attendee]

Right.

That makes sense, but we don't have that in the places where there are farmers farming land.

[Aajonus]

No, it's about getting microorganisms in the ground to break down the minerals to release them.

It's not about putting minerals into the ground, it's already there.

It's you have poisons in the ground that are preventing the fractionation of those to be absorbed by the plants, that's the issue.

[Attendee]

Right.

[Aajonus]

Microorganisms in.

[Attendee]

In our body?

[Aajonus]

Oh.

Well, if you're drinking vegetable juice, you're already doing, you're already doing it.

[Attendee]

Doing what.

[Aajonus]

Providing many minerals and enzymes that you wouldn't normally get and vitamins?

We're not herbivores.

We take vegetables and we juice them, so we have this concentrated mineral solution with lots of vitamins and enzymes.

Those are your supplements.

Taking a cup of vegetable juice a day, even if the soil so-called depleted is 10 times the amount that you would ever get in good soil.

That's why vegetable juice is part of the diet.

.

(14) Dry Scalp, Grey Gair From Aluminum
[2009],[Aajonus]

Yours is not from the normal dryness, yours is from Mercury in your brain and aluminum

And that's until your body stops throwing it off, or you can handle it correctly out of the skin without breaking out.

See, normally the body will build those toxins into the hair follicles and build it into hair.

Yours is just coming out the skin.

So you have good hair, but you don't have good skin.

So, most people will lose their hair because it builds into the follicles, damages the follicle.

Yours is coming right outta your scalp, right outta your skin.

And that's for every vaccine that you've ever had that much to went to your brain.

What you can do is put some bone marrow, rub oily bone marrow at room temperature, rub that into your scalp and see if that will strengthen the RNA and DNA, so you can lose hair instead of losing your scalp.

[Attendees]

Laughs oh boy.

[Aajonus]

Your choice.

[Attendee]

Will the hair grow back after.

[Aajonus]

Not very often?

You see with chemotherapy, this hasn't grown back since I was 22 years old.

[Attendee #2]

Is there, is there any way to get the mercury out without it all coming out his head like that.

[Aajonus]

No?

Yours is mostly aluminum and it turns it grey.

Destroys benzoic acid properties of the follicles.

[Attendee #2]

He hasn't had that many vaccines, but I had a lot of mercury from teeth and pesticides, all kinds of, so do you think from breastfeeding him when he was a baby, that's why.

[Aajonus]

Yes, during gestation and breastfeeding?

[Attendee #2]

And my mother always cooked in aluminum.

[Aajonus]

Almost all gray hair as a result of high aluminum.

[Attendee #2]

So, basically the diet just eventually takes care of this stuff.

There's nothing special.

[Aajonus]

40 years to get rid of the toxins?

I still have 14 years to go.

I'm 62 years old than I'm still alive.

I was supposed to die 42 years ago.

Healthier than I ever was as a child.

This is nothing compared to what I suffered as a child.

[Attendee]

If she stayed on the diet for 40 years, will her hair grow back.

[Aajonus]

Well, even her hair is coming back?

My hair is getting darker.

In mine, I get gray patches, a year ago this was dark.

This is the only thing that doesn't go back and forth.

Used to have a gray patch back here for six years that went away.

So it comes and goes.

As I dump a lot of aluminum out of my brain, then my hair goes gray.

[Attendee]

So, somebody that's healthy and they have a dark head of hair, which is not dyed.

[Aajonus]

Means they're not discarding aluminum out the hair.

[Attendee #3]

It doesn't mean they don't have it.

[Aajonus]

Right?

Doesn't mean they don't have it.

It means you're not discarding.

[Attendee]

I think somebody told me that gray hair is because of the lack of a nutrient.

[Aajonus]

They used to say it was a lack of para amino benzoic acid, B vitamin that regulates pigmentation.

But aluminum destroys it.

[Attendee]

Oh.

.

(15) Eat In Middle Of Night
[2009],[Aajonus]

Okay

Do you have a question.

[Attendee]

Yeah?

I've been on a diet about 14 months now.

I've just been feeling really bad the last month.

I've had a bronchial infection that won't go away and I'm so stiff and sore that it took me about 10 minutes to get out of bed in the morning cuz I can't straighten my legs.

[Aajonus]

Are you waking during the night and eating or are you spending your whole 8 hours asleep.

[Attendee]

Usually asleep?

[Aajonus]

You gotta wake up and eat.

[Attendee]

Really.

[Aajonus]

At your size, you're probably losing 4 - 6 tablespoons of red blood cells?

As soon as 5 hours passes, your blood has not enough protein to feed the red blood cells.

So, the red blood cells start eating other red blood cells for the protein, become cannibalistic.

Fasting is a terrible thing cause you're eating up your red blood cells.

What happens is you wake up with anemia, everybody's waking with anemia, so they go for a drug: caffeine, nicotine, something like that, pump them up, give them energy.

A hundred years ago you had to be rich to afford coffee and nicotine, unless you're growing it.

Now people live on it.

Pardon.

[Attendee]

But they didn't wake up every couple of hours and eat either, right?

[Aajonus]

Well, they weren't as toxic as we are, but they did?

They woke up during the night, absolutely.

Almost everybody that I knew and have interviewed always woke during the night sometime and would have something to nibble on cause they wake up cuz they were hungry.

[Attendee #2]

When I get up to pee at night, I always pop an egg.

[Aajonus]

Pop an egg.

There you go, perfect.

[Attendee]

But I'm really stiff all day too.

It's like anytime I sit.

[Aajonus]

Just remember if you get anemic in the night, you're gonna have a hard time getting going in the morning cuz your body's trying to deal with the anemia.

All of this nutrients are gonna go be going to the bone marrow and your joints.

And if you got toxic bone marrow and toxic joints, because let's say you have Crohn's or some leaky gut problem, you're gonna have the exact symptoms you have.

So, it sounds like you not only have Crohn's, you cause anemia every day.

So, you need to suck eggs all day long.

Probably have 22 a day and wake during the night to have your protein during the night.

Now, if you're a person who wakes after five hours and eats and can't go back to sleep, cuz you have too much energy, then set your alarm for three hours, and then you sleep five hours.

Let me tell you, if you're causing anemia every day, that's gonna go on for ages 6 - 7 years.

So, you need to take care of your basic things, don't get anemic.

Take care of that and these detoxes usually don't last over a year and a half.

Normally, they last about anywhere from 2 - 6 weeks and then they pass on.

Unless you've got a real serious bronchial problem, toxicity, but I've seen them last up to a year and a half.

That's the worst case scenario.

[Attendee]

I've had lung infections for many years before the diet.

[Aajonus]

And you took antibiotics for it.

[Attendee]

No?

[Aajonus]

Oh, good.

[Attendee]

But I did take colloidal silver.

[Aajonus]

Poison yourself with minerals.

(16) Farmed Fishoysters, What Fish To Eat
[2009],[Aajonus]

And I'd like people to get fat to have the buffering to protect them from the poisons in the body

Do you have a question, Lorraine.

[Attendee]

Yeah?

I told you I'm gonna go over it Italy soon.

I've seen a lot of squid and octopus there.

Is it okay to eat that stuff.

[Aajonus]

Well, they're farmed?

[Attendee]

They're farmed.

[Aajonus]

Farmed oysters and clams, all they can do is put a fence out in the ocean and the government tells them that they have to call it farmed, but they're still eating whats out in the ocean.

Sometimes what they'll do is they'll do is, you've got a baby clam attached to another clam and they won't grow till they're full size, unless they're broken off and transplanted.

So, that's what they do in these farms.

They're still getting fed just by the ocean.

[Attendee]

So, cod and like red snapper.

Are those okay.

[Aajonus]

Those are ocean?

Tuna, swordfish, I mostly eat swordfish.

When I'm in the Philippines, I mostly eat tuna.

[Attendee]

You can't get salmon anymore.

[Aajonus]

No, I don't like salmon too much because it's too much from lakes and they've set a lot of genetically modified salmon loose and they're crossbreeding now.

[Attendee]

So, we're eating GMO salmon.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, GMO salmon?

So, I don't touch salmon anymore.

[Attendee #2]

How about salmon from from Tasmania.

[Aajonus]

Tasmania be okay?

[Attendee #2]

Because Newport Beach, they fly it in every day.

[Aajonus]

Tasmania's an island off of Australia.

[Attendee]

But it says wild.

Isn't that okay if it says wild.

[Aajonus]

No, because now they let they've let the salmon, the genetically modified salmon breed with the wild salmon?

They're only talking about Santa.

Yeah.

Anything that's from the ocean that isn't salmon.

[Attendee #2]

What about Alaska.

Salmon from Alaska?

[Aajonus]

Doesn't make any difference.

That's where they mainly let them loose.

.

(17) Frozen Meat & Butter
[2009],[Aajonus]

When I did experiments with animals and fed them frozen meats, they all got skin disorders within six weeks

I had two groups.

The animals that I fed the same meat that wasn't frozen, had no disorders.

I didn't feed them water, anything.

They only ate the meat for that 6 - 10 week period.

Then all of the animals who got the skin disorder, one even got scabies.

I took those animals and I split them in half and fed them half raw butter and half frozen butter.

The same butter, some of it frozen, some of it unfrozen.

The animals that I gave the frozen butter to took five times longer to heal their skin disorder.

So, freezing does affect it.

I don't care what Sally Fallon or anybody else says, they have never done the experiments I have.

So don't freeze anything.

Well, you can just freeze fruits, nothing harms fruits.

[Attendee]

Cheese.

[Aajonus]

Cheese.

You don't wanna freeze cheese.

[Attendee]

Fish.

[Aajonus]

Well, if you get arctic fish, that's okay.

[Attendee]

Everything comes down frozen from the boats.

[Aajonus]

As long as it's an arctic fish.

Do you have a question.

[Attendee #2]

I do?

I just have a note for that because you said the dog had psoriasis.

I've been feeding it just the stuff from the supermarket, like natural Tyson or whatever.

[Aajonus]

It could be frozen.

[Attendee #2]

They freeze it.

It looks like it's fresh, but it's probably frozen now that you said that.

Is that why he's got the skin problems.

[Aajonus]

Yep?

[Attendee #2]

And should you take the skin off.

They shouldn't have the skin?

[Aajonus]

Right.

And you can't give them frozen meats.

[Attendee #3]

Previously frozen, but they'll say fresh.

[Aajonus]

Well, there are others that don't say that.

They say fresh.

.

(18) Grass Is Acidic, Only 5% Of Juice Certain Herbs
[2009],[Daniel]

You've previously said grasses are acidic, once you told me if I want any

[Aajonus]

They're acidic to the blood, they're alkanizing in the intestines.

The exact opposite of what you want.

[Daniel]

But you said if I wanted to take some wild groom grass, that's not wheat grass.

Especially for the mineral content and salt content for that, I could put a couple ounces into the milk.

Besides those grasses, is there a reason you don't use kale or dandelion, spinach in your juices.

[Aajonus]

Well, I said you can use those, but never more than 5% of the juice because they will be very detoxifying or chemically changing to the body?

So, any kind of a herb that is that strong.

You need to keep it at a low ratio, no more than 5%.

[Attendee]

What do you mean chemical changing.

What does it change?

[Aajonus]

It can change your blood, it can change your intestines, it can change the chemistry of everything?

All of a sudden you find yourself way outta whack.

[Attendee]

Get kidney stones or.

[Aajonus]

Get all kinds, I've seen all kinds of issues, endless issues?

[Attendee]

So, when should you use those.

[Aajonus]

Anytime you want to use it?

It doesn't matter, as long as it's never more than 5% of your juice.

.

(19) Herbivores, Vegetarians, Vegetalbe Oils
[2009],[Attendee]

Versus eating a lot of salads

[Aajonus]

You can't digest it.

Herbivore has 2.

5 times more digestive tract than we do, they have 60,000 more digestive enzymes for breaking down the cellulose molecule to get the fat and protein, takes 48 hours or more for food to pass through their systems with 60% - 80% of it digested, not even all of it digested.

2% in ours, that's it.

2% in 24 hours.

It over alkalizes the intestines and neutralizes all of that hydrochloric acid that you have in the stomach and the small intestines to break down your food particles to smaller amounts so bacteria can eat them.

Our bacteria is the acidic nature.

The fluids, the alkaline fluids from whole vegetables will neutralize those, so you stop digesting.

I'm saying don't eat whole vegetables.

I'm saying drink the vegetable juice cuz you can get all the minerals, vitamins, and the enzymes from the vegetation, that we can handle.

That's the 2%.

[Attendee]

In nature you wouldn't have a juicer.

[Aajonus]

Well, do like the dogs, cats, and the gorillas.

They chew it and spit out the fiber.

They're juicing in their mouth.

[Attendee #2]

Is that what you do in Thailand or do you get juice in Thailand.

[Aajonus]

I can get juice in Thailand?

[Attendee #3]

And for the salad, I think you said don't have it with oil or vinegar or something.

[Aajonus]

Because it coats it?

It comes and I said if you're going to eat vegetation, you eat a salad and you eat it last thing in the day.

[Attendee #3]

But you don't put any olive oil on it.

[Aajonus]

You can make a cheese sauce, something like that?

[Attendee #3]

Right.

But why don't you want oil on it or vinegar.

[Aajonus]

It coats the vegetation?

[Attendee #3]

What if you just have vinegar on it.

Is that okay?

[Aajonus]

It's okay?

You'll start fermenting it.

It'll digest a little bit better with that.

[Attendee]

It won't feel good on your stomach if you put oil on it.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends upon the person, some people can handle it?

Italians and Greeks are used to it.

But that's centuries.

You can't digest that cellulose.

[Attendee #3]

But you say you eat cooked food, you have to have the raw salad.

[Aajonus]

Let's say you eat cooked meat, you better have a raw salad with it, or else it's not gonna move, it'll putrefy?

Do you have a question.

[Attendee]

I have trouble running?

I couldn't get my body moving and I'm just trying to start.

I'm sleeping a lot.

[Aajonus]

Okay, I can see your skin.

You don't have any good animal fats in your body.

You have a lot of grain, acetates that are made from grains.

[Attendee]

I've been doing 20 years of vegetarian diet?

[Aajonus]

There you go.

[Attendee]

How much can I jump in to this.

[Aajonus]

People jump into it wholeheartedly?

Just remember this, 50% of my cancer clients are long-term vegetarians and vegetable oils cause all the hardening of the arteries in the heart because they crystallize, we can't digest them.

[Attendee]

So, it's not like arthritis and stuff.

[Aajonus]

Well, you don't have any lubrication in your body, good fats?

You don't have any good animal fats in your body.

Butter, cream.

[Attendee]

Is the honey really essential.

[Aajonus]

No, it isn't essential?

Sure gonna help you digest, but it isn't essential.

For some people it is.

So, I suggest you go into the Recipe Book and on page 146 and make the moisturizing formula.

Make a good moisturizing formula and sip that throughout the day.

.

(20) Honey For Pancreas, Honey Dissolved Bones
[2009],[Attendee]

Having so much sugar, honey

[Aajonus]

Honey isn't sugar when it's completely raw?

The bees collect the nectar, nectar's 90% carbs, so it's sugar.

When the bee collects it, it swallows it.

It produces an insulin-like substance, which converts 90% of those carbs into enzymes for digesting proteins and fats.

Let me give you an example.

While I was in Thailand three months ago before I went to the Philippines, I went to see some patients on the Costa Mui island and they spearfished.

So, I went spear fishing with them and one of the big fish that we caught had these big vertebrae's and the his Thai girlfriend who's almost 50 years old.

She grew up in the old country where they eat lots of raw foods, so she's a total raw fooder and eats everything perfectly even better than her American boyfriend who's on the diet.

So, she's the ideal primal dieter.

She'll go in and pick all the Japanese beetles off of her flowers and all day long she eat them live.

You have to understand, Thai's eat a lot of insects cuz there isn't a lot of meat there cuz they over hunted and the population got so large, so they eat a lot of insects, I mean, scorpions, cockroaches that are this big, all these things.

Eat them raw, even alive.

So, she had these vertebraes, big vertebraes like this, and her teeth are so good, 50 years old, perfect teeth, and she's eating these bones.

I wish I could have eaten a bone, I mean, she gave me a little piece of one and I just kept it in my mouth for hours.

I took a half a teaspoon of honey and put in my mouth with the bone and disintegrated the bone in five minutes.

[Attendee]

So, my question is, eating the honey isn't that going to spike the blood sugar.

[Aajonus]

What did I just say?

You've got insulin in the honey?

The bee has created an insulin.

If you heat that honey over 93°, you've destroyedthe insulin and it goes back to sugar.

You're gonna spike.

However, honey can cause old toxic glycogen in your body to detox, then you're going to spike, but you never look for your sugar level.

You look for symptoms.

If you're passing out, if you can't breathe, you've got an insulin problem.

That's the only time if you're passing out, not because you're getting up too fast, but you don't have enough blood sugar to run the brain and nervous system and lungs, you've got diabetes.

85% - 90% of the people who the medical profession put on insulin to and call diabetic are not diabetic.

They just have sugar balancing sugar level problems.

If you've got a true insulin problem, you're not metabolizing your sugars to run your brain and nervous system, you're not going to breathe.

You're gonna go into a coma in three days.

If you don't have any of those symptoms, you are not diabetic.

[Attendee]

I read to tell if you have an insulin problem, if you weigh yourself in the morning, and then if you go up 1 pound - 1.

[Aajonus]

Absolute bullshit.

You can have water retention.

You can have high blood pressure, will do the same thing.

You have to understand the pharmaceutical industry makes their money off of you taking drugs.

They're gonna do everything they can to get you to take drugs.

Every test in the world, they're going to show you need to take drugs now, like say cholesterol.

Now, they used to say that 50 years ago, cholesterol levels of 300 were okay.

Now, they're not saying that.

They want people to take all these, the anti-cholesterol medications to lower cholesterol, so they dropped it way down into 150 and 160 to keep making money.

It's all about making money.

.

(21) Honey, How To Know If Unheated
[2009],[Attendee]

And what's the true honey you told me about

[Aajonus]

Well, I got a Filipino honey where we just went to a beekeeper and they gave me honey straight from the hive?

[Attendee]

How do you know if the honey's good, because they said if the honey crystallized, that means it's real honey, so I have honey that's just liquid.

Stays liquid.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, well all honey will crystallize if it's raw.

Sage honey can take up to a year, year and a half to crystallize.

It depends upon the honey.

[Attendee]

So, how about if it doesn't crystallize in three months that's not sage.

[Aajonus]

It still depends upon the type of honey?

It could take anywhere from three months to a year and a half for honey to crystalize.

[Attendee]

Okay, so the question is how do I get to know that's real, honey.

[Aajonus]

You have to go to the place who makes the honey?

What brand is it.

It's gotta say unheated?

We do not heat this honey at all in processing.

[Attendee]

It says raw.

[Aajonus]

Raw doesn't mean a thing.

Raw they can heat it up to 170°.

Honey can't be heated over 93°.

[Attendee]

Oh, so in the book says, just say raw honey.

[Aajonus]

In my book?

No, it says we do not heat this honey in processing and it stays unheated?

And then you have to ask the beekeeper.

It's gotta say unheated, raw doesn't mean a thing.

I say that in the book.

[Attendee #2]

Don't take his word for it.

Go watch him take it out of the hive.

That's the only way to know.

[Aajonus]

It's the only way to truly know.

[Attendee #3]

beekeepers won't heat your honey.

Only the big ones do.

[Aajonus]

No, little ones will do it too to bottle it faster.

[Attendee #2]

They also heat it when it crystallizes, the water back it up to 120°.

And then I'll ask them, have you ever heated the honey.

And they'll say, No?

And then I ask them, what's your bell heater for your five gallon bucket or your water heater.

What do you set the temperature at?

[Aajonus]

You just have to go to 'em?

You have to say, listen, when you spin some honey, I'd like you to bottle some for me right then and there and don't strain it.

Because you want it completely unheated.

Cause what they do is they spin it, put it in cauldrons, it will set, it'll get very thick and then they have to heat it to pour it fast.

[Attendee]

But the guy in the store didn't want to give me the beekeepers address.

[Aajonus]

It doesn't say on the bottle.

[Attendee]

No?

[Aajonus]

Doesn't say a name on the bottles.

Don't they have a name and address of the producer?

[Attendee]

No, he gets from a bulk.

[Aajonus]

Oh, then if he doesn't give it to you, I'd take it back to him.

Well, there's some honeys that are available here you get right out of the store and there's Y.

S there's quite a few of them Really Raw, those brands.

There is Honey Pacifica, but they don't sell that in regular markets.

[At one point Honey Pacifica started feeding sugar in the winter, so Aajonus stopped buying.

It may have changed since, I haven't checked.

(22) Joint Problems, Leaky Gut, Lots Of Eggs
[2009],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]

Yeah?

I've got a lot of joint problems, including some deterioration.

What can I do.

[Aajonus]

It all depends why you have it?

80% - 90% of all deterioration of the joints comes from leaky gut.

Intestinal production mucus is very shallow and the mucus fibers are very open, so your own digestive acids and juices get into there and bacteria start eating your own intestinal walls.

They get so thin that if you eat a lot at one time, drink a lot, it rips, the gut, and then you have leaky gut.

You have undigested food that will go to the joints for digestion.

It's 80% - 90% of all arthritis and rheumatism comes from that.

So, I would say look to there first.

[Attendee]

Then what's the best thing if that was the case.

[Aajonus]

That's a whole diet in itself for Crohn's, It's mostly eggs?

You need anywhere from 24 - 32 eggs a egg.

Eggs digest in 27 minutes, only takes 3 - 5 inches of the intestine to absorb, completely digest and absorb eggs, so you get all this fat protein with very little energy expense on digestion.

So, you get to reserve all of your intestinal tract and you reserve the energy absorbing, digesting and assimilating all the eggs.

[Attendee]

What about butter.

Would you eat butter with the eggs?

[Aajonus]

No?

[Attendee]

Tiny bit.

[Aajonus]

No, because then you're causing a problem in digestion?

I'm not saying don't eat any other thing, but I'd have to see his eyes to be able to determine what to suggest.

Right off I would say eggs, sipping on milk, never gulping.

You never gulp anything.

The H20 rushes to the kidneys, you piss it out, so then you're nutrients cannot carry H2O to the cells, so you sip.

You see me when I sip, I don't sip, I suck.

You see, when I do it, I suck.

Keep my teeth together, put my tongue there, and I force whatever I'm drinking through.

Why.

Like a baby's sucking, gets all that bacteria into the milk?

So, I digest very easily, so I never get dehydrated.

And I drink maybe two quarts of fluid a day, but that's in the form of milk and the fruit and the meat.

Meats 55% water, milk is 82% - 86% water.

So, you have all of this fluid in your food as long as it's raw and it's all ionically attached.

So, you can utilize a 100% of the water in your raw foods.

Once you cook it, you fractionate all of that.

You drink water, same thing as eating salt, fractionates those smorgasborg of nutrient.

Dilute your digestive acids, all kinds of problems.

[Attendee]

You said fruit.

What kind of fruit do you eat.

[Aajonus]

Well, you saw me eat the watermelon rind?

[Attendee]

That's right.

But you didn't eat it with cream.

[Aajonus]

I had some cream with berries first?

[Attendee]

Oh, okay.

Because I get heartburn from everything.

[Aajonus]

I always eat fat with my food.

Always, always, always.

And I say that in both books, always eat fat with fruits.

[Attendee]

So, could it be cheese or butter.

Or does it have to be milk?

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter what you want it to be?

It be any of the fats: avocado, cheese, butter cream.

Just remember, if you eat cream, it's harder to digest and you'll have a tendency to retain more water, but you still need at least two tablespoons of cream a day in addition to whatever's in your milk, unless you've added it to your milk already.

.

(23) Motorcycle Accident
[2009],[Aajonus]

Hello folks

I had another motorcycle accident six weeks ago.

I took all the skin off from here to here, all of it off there.

The reason this isn't healing like the last one healed in 12 days is I put the lime juice on it and then the honey, and then the coconut cream and then the meat.

But this one didn't because I didn't hit pavement.

There was a road under construction in the Philippines and they use big rocks, not gravel, and they use layers of gypsum.

Gypsums what they use in drywall, cause it's very drying, 5 times more drying than sulfur.

So, they had layers of gypsum on this, and they had a section where there was a part of the road done, it was coned off, so you couldn't use it.

And this was gravel with gypsum and the traffic is supposed to wait for one direction to finish before the next.

They didn't wait for me to finish and a van came barreling 100 kilometers an hour, knocked me right off the bike and hit the gravel, didn't even stop.

So, this is all gypsum in here.

You can see it looks like sandpaper.

The lime in Philippines is not real lime, it's like orange.

So, even though it's very green and small, it's more like orange.

[Attendee]

So, what would be something that would be drawing that would pull the gypsum out.

[Aajonus]

Well, gypsums gonna draw itself out and I did find that aloe helped?

I strapped a piece of aloe to it, which helped for about a week.

But I had to let the white cells just take it out.

So, I lost a lot of white cells, that's why I'm very thin right now cause I lost a lot of fat.

White cells are fat to pull the gypsum out.

It's almost finished now, but it's still very painful.

[Attendee]

How long is that.

How many weeks?

[Aajonus]

It's been six weeks?

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Six weeks!

When I had the accident two years ago, when I split this femur down the center and broke the tibia off into the femur joint.

That took me only six weeks to heal, and I had twice as much skin gone.

This whole bone here was shaved off, this bone was shaved off and this bone shaved off and this healed fast because I didn't land on the gypsum like the leg did.

So, this skin was all gone, this was ripped all the way down to the bone and all that was gone to the bone.

But you see how quickly it goes without the gypsum.

Another problem was I went to get some honey and this woman sold me honey, it wasn't truly honey and I didn't find that out til 9 days of putting this other junk on.

What they do is they make a honey, they've got a fruit in in Philippines that if you put it with sweet and low, that's what they do.

It was sweet and low.

It tastes like Thai honey.

So, I had just come from Thailand, so I saw Thai honey.

I thought, oh they got Thai honey.

So, after putting that on for nine days, and it was looking worse and worse and I knew it wasn't from just from the gypsum.

So, I asked the taxi driver to help me to apply it to work on it cause it was still open this far and it was quite a mess.

So, he came in and he goes to put the honey on and said, "This isn't honey.

This is a mixture that they make and they call it Thai honey and it's really not.

They make it with sweet and low or as you know, aspartame and all these chemicals".

So I was drinking, I drank about a cup of that.

Plus put it on my leg for all that time.

So, for nine days I poisoned my body with this stuff.

And then it caused an insulin detox.

A lot of people who take insulin as they get older, the insulin builds up and it causes toxicity like this.

And of course they have their toes amputated and feet and all on up.

So, I hadn't had insulin since I was 22 years old, but for some reason that forced insulin detoxification.

And I used to shoot it here in my thigh cuz I didn't like shooting in my arms, I shot it in my arms a lot, so I started getting the same detoxifications of insulin.

It smelled exactly like the insulin I used to shoot up.

So, I had a big sore here that got this big, one on the back of the arm and another one here you can here.

They're coming out and I haven't had insulin for 42 years.

[Attendee]

And how did you detect that was what it was.

[Aajonus]

The smell?

Just like stuff I used to inject.

It's got that sweet, odd odor to it.

At least they did.

I haven't had it in 42 years, so I don't know what it's like now.

What's the insulin like now.

[Attendee]

I never took it?

[Aajonus]

Oh, you never took it.

[Attendee]

They wanted me to, but I never did.

[Aajonus]

So, I will force it to puss a little bit and most of the time it will run the liquid the same color as the insulin.

See, I won't break these because I want to keep pussing until it's clean.

It will stop cussing once it's clean.

Now, most people would run to the doctor.

Doctor, say, "Oh, you've got a staph infection.

We need to give you a lot of antibiotics".

So what happens.

The poisons stay in the body, it poisons the body?

The body stops digesting, can no longer detoxify.

So, then all that matter would stay in there and cause problems.

Now, since I was about 16 years old and started taking the insulin, I had these lumps in my thighs and my thighs were always very large.

Right now, you can see on this leg too, but my legs are thinner than they've been since I was 15.

5 years old, since I started taking insulin, but I had huge lumps in there that were sore.

So, anytime I got a massage, even if it were a light massage I would have pain there.

So, I would say you have to be very gentle with my calves.

So, here I can push, there's no more lumps.

So, you just have to get through these things.

You can't freak out cuz the medical profession get all their training in emergency wards, so everything is panic time.

So, and then the pharmaceutical industry wants 'em to think that way because anybody will make a bad decision in a panic and fear.

[Attendee]

So, initially when that happened to you, did you just get lime on it right away or.

[Aajonus]

Like I said, the lime they have, there aren't actually lime?

They're oranges, really.

They're tiny oranges.

So, that didn't work.

And plus I didn't have the proper honey.

I didn't have honey at all, until that taxi driver showed me that it was wasn't honey and then he took the, to the place and we got honey.

And then the whole, the next day, 90% of the pussing stopped, 90% of the irritation stopped.

[Attendee]

So, will that scar over or not.

Do you think that'll scar?

[Aajonus]

Probably not?

This right here was just like this and this, there's no scarring there.

So, just takes time.

You just have to be patient, can't freak out and panic.

[Attendee]

So, now what are you doing when you're home.

[Aajonus]

I don't do anything, but put urine on it?

Anything else irritates it, coconut cream, anything irritates, except urine.

So, I put old stinky urine on it.

[Attendee]

And that does what.

[Aajonus]

And that keeps it from drying out, getting very sore and it soothes it?

Now, the urine is nothing other than the blood without the red and white blood cells.

So, all the nutrition that's in your blood is what's in the urine with a little ammonia added, so when I put that on, it gets a good supply.

Now, right now, everything that it's getting up to the skin is irritated because of the chemicals.

So, when I put the urine on, it's getting a fresh coat of nutrients like it would from the blood, from the outside in.

[Attendee]

Just once a day.

[Aajonus]

I usually do once a day?

[Attendee]

And you just pour it on.

[Aajonus]

I pour it on?

If I run my fingers over these areas right here, they're like crystals from the mineral buildup and the insulin.

Cause the insulin has a tendency to crystallized, so it's very sharp.

So, if I touch this, it'll stab inside and be painful.

Even my pants can cause pain if they rub it the wrong one.

[Attendee]

And how about the one on your shoulder.

[Aajonus]

I just live with the pain?

I just ignore it as much as possible.

[Attendee]

And the shoulder, you put urine on that too.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

But that's almost all over.

These were huge.

I used to shoot my insulin in this arm, until I couldn't take it anymore.

Then I started shooting it mainly in this side, but once in a while on side.

[Attendee]

So, you'll probably feel better after cuz all the crap.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's what I mean?

I think I'll not have that same soreness in the calf now.

I'll be able to run better and I'll be able to take massages better.

[Attendee]

Are you swollen quite a bit.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah, this whole calf, this whole ankle was swollen?

But if you consider the size of my calf, they have normally my calves were huge.

So, actually my calf is smaller even with the swelling.

So, when the swelling on both legs goes down, my calves are gonna be the smallest they've been since I was probably 13 years old.

[Attendee]

And you knew you didn't break anything.

[Aajonus]

No, didn't break anything?

[Attendee]

You didn't have any x-rays or anything.

[Aajonus]

I didn't have to.

When I had the accident 2.

5 years ago, the pain was so excruciating in the knee and the shin that I knew I had broken it.

[Attendee]

Did you ever have a follow up with that doctor.

No?

I wanted to wait till the leg could straighten and it's still not completely straightened.

Straighten.

[Attendee #2]

Did you have a short pants on when you fell.

[Aajonus]

Short pants, short sleeved shirt with a helmet?

Did have a helmet on.

A rock flew up and hit me here, so I had an abrasion there and a couple here.

But this time, I tumbled, I just let myself slide.

When I saw this, I was falling over, I kicked the bike away, hit the gravel, and then flipped.

So, I probably didn't skid on this for more than probably two feet before I started tumbling.

[Attendee #2]

So, the lesson is.

.

.

[Attendee]

Don't ride a motorcycle.

[Aajonus]

When I drove back, see I left at sunrise from the hotel to go down Palawan Island and I had just gotten there the night before late, and I'd rented the motorcycle just before this place closed at like 9:00 PM, and it was just a motorbike, 125.

It wasn't like a big motorcycle when I had this accident.

That was a big Harley about 350 pound bike.

This was probably 150 - 175 pounds.

And, I left very early on a Sunday morning to go take a tour down the end of the island and they said most of the island doesn't have paved roads.

So, I knew I was getting into, but I had no idea there were crazy drivers that had no respect for anybody on a motorcycle.

So, as soon as I had the accident, I was two hours down the island and I had to drive two hours back and I saw everybody on a motorbike when a car would come, they'd go over to the side and almost slow down to a stop.

Now I've been on six other islands in the Philippines and nobody drove like that, but here they do no, respect for motorcyclists.

[Attendee]

I thought you were gonna say not to trust anybody's that's honey and this and that.

[Aajonus]

That too.

I was really upset with that woman.

[Attendee]

You couldn't taste it.

[Aajonus]

They learned to mix it so well that it tastes identical to Thai honey; the thickness and everything?

But it didn't react that way, I was getting dizzy, I was getting nauseous and I thought it was just the gypsum getting into the blood and it was the honey.

It wasn't until the 9th day till I got the true honey and then a lot of the symptoms stopped right away.

[Attendee #2]

So, you applied the honey for what.

To heal?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it helps heal?

You read my books.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah?

[Aajonus]

I talk about it increases healing five times.

.

(24) Nausea, Vomit, Dog Licking
[2009],[Attendee]

I had another one of these major stomach pain episodes, like three hours, four hours

.

.

[Aajonus]

And what, what are your symptoms.

[Attendee]

Just nausea, vomiting?

[Aajonus]

Diarrhea.

[Attendee]

No, not at all?

[Aajonus]

Okay.

What what happens when you get nauseous have vomit; poisons dump into the stomach.

Fr example, she'll put bacteria on you.

Whenever a dog or cat licks you, they're putting bacteria, janitorial bacteria on to eat the dead cells and the bad tissue.

We used to have a lot of salmonella now that we take showers and baths and we're so toxic in our environment the 6,000 varieties of salmonella that used to live on the skin and eat the skin are no longer present.

So, dogs and cats will come up and lick and give you a dose of their bacteria from their mouths.

We have more bacteria than they do, so you can lick youw own.

I do that.

I'll put saliva in here, go over it after I put the urine on it, cuz the ammonia in the urine is antiseptic and I need to re-infiltrate the bacteria.

Because the old urine doesn't absorb the same for some reason, don't know why.

Probably as you let it sit, the ammonia breaks down and the antiseptic effect leaves.

[Attendee #2]

So, it's better fresh.

[Aajonus]

No, it's better non fresh?

See, the kidneys manufacture ammonia to be able to separate the red and white blood cells from the blood serum.

If you pissed at all of your red and white blood cells from your blood and not just the fluid out of it, you'd be anemic all the time.

You couldn't function, and you can only replace about 4 - 5 tablespoons of red blood cells in a day.

So, if you urinate, let's say a quart a day, that would be a huge amount of red and white blood cell loss.

The ammonia is very active when your kidney first makes it to separate the red and white blood cells from it, so you can lose fluids.

You lose fluids to get rid of some toxins sometimes, but that's not the major reason.

It's usually to keep the body warmer and you notice when you get cold, you urinate a lot.

Thicken the blood, and then when you get very warm, then you stop urinating so much and your blood thins itself?

You have more fluid in the bloodstream, less red and white blood cells.

So, the kidneys are mainly for that, regulating body temperature.

The spleen can help there cuz it holds extra red blood cells, spleen doesn't manufacture anything like the kidney does, but the spleen holds excess red blood cells.

Like say, when you were a cave person, you're swinging around in a tree, branch broke and as you were falling down the tree cut your juggler and you lost a cup of blood.

Now you'd be at very anemic with a cup of blood loss and you'd probably be good dinner, cuz you wouldn't be able to run fast enough from a tiger or lion.

So, the body has this reserve of red blood cells in the spleen.

So, you can dump up to almost two pints of red blood cells right back into the bloodstream, so you're not anemic.

You know, that was a long answer.

Anyway.

The poisons dump into the stomach that causes nausea, Any time you have nausea, poisons are dumping into the dumping into the stomach, and it's a good passage for that because we have hydrochloric acid there.

The highest concentration in our bodies is in the stomach.

So, it's like the Indians when they used to get a snake bite, a poisonous snake bite, they knew it went to the stomach, so they'd try to get some milk or some corn, which has a lot of hydrochloric acid precursors or root beets and eat those, shave those.

And they usually kept some around buried in case of poisonous bites from the snakes, scorpion or spider, whatever, and they would drink the milk or eat the corn or the beets and that would create more hydrochloric acid and help neutralize the poison.

You can take any kind of rattle poison, the worst in the world, copper head and you mix a little hydrochloric acid and neutralizes it like that.

So, that's what happens with our stomachs, used that way.

So, when you get nauseous, your body's dumping the poisons there, wants to vomit it, or enough hydrochloric acid.

And when you get nauseous, more hydrochloric acid, the more nauseous you get, the more hydrochloric acid dumps in, more the stomach manufacturers, dumps it into the stomach interior, so it neutralizes the poison.

However, you can eat cheese, raw unsalted cheese and it will absorb those poisons so you don't have to use so much hydrochloric acid and you're not to experience all that nausea.

[Attendee]

Why unsalted.

[Aajonus]

Because when you have salted it fractionates the molecules, acts like cooked, and you will reabsorb and digest the cheese and you don't want to digest the cheese?

You want the poisons to send through the body and pass out with your feces.

[Attendee]

You're talking about a snake bike.

[Aajonus]

Any kind of a poisonous bite?

[Attendee #2]

So, with the salt, would sea minerals do the same thing.

That's bad too or?

[Aajonus]

Sea minerals won't do it as well?

However, clay can.

.

(25) Osteroproosis
[2009],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]

Yes?

This is for a lady, my friend.

She has osteoperosis, she's 42.

She's getting a pre-osteoperosis problems.

And I try her read in the book or something about that.

And you just say that pasteurized milk causes that.

[Aajonus]

Well, many things cause osteoporosis, but that's one of them.

[Attendee]

What can she do to reverse the symptoms.

[Aajonus]

Well, like I said in the book, she can drink raw milk, she can eat lots of cheese?

Cheese a couple of times a day with honey.

When you eat cheese, raw cheese, no salt raw cheese with honey, you'll actually digest the cheese.

Now any food that's dehydrated has no bioactive enzymes, difficulty to digest.

Dog, and a cat can't even digest much raw cheese that's unsalted.

Check the feces, passes out whole almost.

Dog and a cat will get a high amount of hydrochloric acid, they may digest at the most 50% and human at the most 20%.

If you eat honey with it, you're providing enzymes to digest the minerals in the cheese and some of the fat and protein, so cheese all day long, and a little bit to absorb heavy metals and poison.

Because when your body eats its own bone, it's doing it because it's low in calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium.

The alkalizing minerals to alkanize the acidic poisons in the body, and you produce a lot of the acidic poisons just by cooking food.

Then if you add a all the food additives along with it, MSG and everything, you've got quite an array of toxins where your body has to use a vast amount of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus so it eats your own bones to do it.

Well, many things cause osteoporosis, but that's one of them.

[Attendee]

She's in an environment that there is no raw milk at all.

[Aajonus]

She needs to move or get some cows or goats there order.

Where does she live.

[Attendee]

San Paulo, Brazil?

[Aajonus]

I got milk in San Paulo.

All you had to do is go out, there are mountains around there and there are people with goats all over the place.

You can get goats milk.

She's just gonna have to have somebody go get it for her if she doesn't have the strength to go get it.

[Attendee #2]

So, the goat milk is okay.

[Aajonus]

If you don't have anything else?

Absolutely.

.

(26) Penicillin
[2009],[Attendee]

Iris is in February

You said, I've got a lot of penicillin in my body.

What has that got to do with the fact that I can't digest cooked foods.

That's why I'm on the diet?

I'm on the diet almost four years and I do great as long as they eat everything that hetells me.

[Aajonus]

No, that was your rosacea and your splotching on your face.

That's from the penicillin.

Now what happens is, penicillin is a bird fungus.

When birds have eaten grains that they haven't digested properly, and let's say they're breaking cells down and the body needs help, say they've gone through a long drought, then a fungus will appear.

Penicillin will appear and help break down those cells that are built off of this carbohydrate, grains.

We would never have penicillin in the human body, except that we eat grain food: breads, cakes, pastas; anything made of grain and the cells are made of those products, fungus can live off of.

Now, we wouldn't normally have that variety of of penicillin, but the pharmaceutical industry is made of penicillin that when injected in us lives forever, because when they sterilize it, they damage the RNA and DNA to tell it to go into hibernation.

That on and off switch.

They damaged it, so it'll always be active.

That doesn't mean that the penicillin is a bad thing because it will only eat damaged tissue that was built on grain foods, so with a lot of carbohydrate.

So, it's a beneficial fungus as long as it doesn't get out of control andmakes your life miserable.

[Attendee]

So, what's that connection with the, the fact that I here for several years wasn't able to digest food, cooked foods.

[Aajonus]

Well that was cause you weren't digesting and absorbing anything because it was cooked, plus you have lots of toxicity in your intestines.

It came to the point where you just can't digest, unless it's raw.

And there's a lot of people that come to that point.

.

(27) Salt
[2009],[Aajonus]

One lump of salt this big, pure sodium, sodium salt

There's no chloride, there's no potassium, there's no iodine connected with it is more powerful than an atomic bomb.

When your body takes in sodium chloride, potassium, sodium, or any of those table salts, it fractionate, it separates that, and the sodium becomes an isolated substance and it'll start causing tiny explosions in your blood.

So, when your cells go to eat, there's a smorgasborg of nutrients anywhere from 93 to 117 nutrients all coupled together.

So, when a cell eats, the ions opens up, takes it in, it gets a whole smorgasborg, a complete balanced diet.

When you eat salt, it causes these little explosions and all these things will fractionate into as small as 7 - 23, even 30 molecules is about the most.

The cell is never getting a balanced diet again, that's what salt does.

[Attendee]

So, that would even the case with like sea salta.

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter what salt?

It's concentrated sodium and it's not sodium in a plant where your ions are properly bound with other nutrients, there's no regulation on it.

You can even kill a plant if you put salt in the ground and you'll kill a plant quickly, unless that plant is built to handle sodium, concentrated sodium.

[Attendee]

So, why is it there are so many animals that go into salt licks.

[Aajonus]

But they only do it on a rare occasion?

They also have problems for a few days and that way they won't touch it again for another year, two years.

[Attendee]

They must need it.

[Aajonus]

No, they like that salty, sweet?

They have a mineral need and maybe they're not eating enough dirt because they're in desert, because mainly all animals eat dirt with their food.

All animals eat dirt with their food, every one.

So, they're getting lots of minerals, but in a desert it isn't like that.

There's not a lot, there's sand that doesn't break down as easily as the minerals in dirt.

Plus they've got a long digestive tract to take 'em through, to hold up and utilize the minerals.

But when you have salt blocks, then you're dealing with all these side effects and dehydrating the body.

Well you have to eat salt hydrate the body.

Well if that's true, you could fricking drink the sea water.

But what happens if you drink sea water.

You will die?

You will dehydrate.

You got that, you will dehydrate and die from salt water and they say that the salt water in the ocean is the same concentration of salt in the blood, doesn't make any difference.

In the blood it has many nutrients utilizing it in precise ways.

In in sea water, you don't have that.

If we were fish, be a different situation, but we're not fish.

[Attendee]

Can you tell me what I would do when I have that reaction.

Milk or?

[Aajonus]

Well, I would put a hot water bottle there very quickly?

[Attendee]

So, get out of the water.

If I even add all that stuff for water, is it probably still not enough to chelate everything.

[Aajonus]

It may not be enough?

Your water belt now is so toxic with those fire contamination, I double that amount of stuff.

What you might do is just double the vinegar.

[Attendee]

So, what does the flame do.

Why would a certain organ react and not another?

[Aajonus]

It probably isn't your spleen?

, it's probably your pancreas.

[Attendee]

And the pancreas is here and it's probably traveling a little bit with the nerves.

[Attendee]

So, is that like a poisons trying to get out a specific organ.

Why do you get a pain in a certain area?

Is it just triggering a detox?

[Aajonus]

Certain sound vibrations can cause people to detox certain things and you happen to be sensitive to the frequency of water, that's all I can think of?

[Attendee]

Doesn't the water also gas off the chemicals.

[Aajonus]

Oh, absolutely?

[Attendee]

And you're breathing it in.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, unless you have the milk in there to draw it down?

You can put clay in the water too to have extra insurance.

Now that I have well water in Malibu Mountains Canyon.

It's really nice water, no contamination.

.

(28) Spleen
[2009],[Aajonus]

Rope and another branches, falling down a tree, cut your juggler and you lost a cup of blood

Now, you'd be very anemic with a cup of blood loss and you'd probably be good dinner cuz you wouldn't be able to run fast enough from a tiger or a lion.

So, the body has this reserve of red blood cells in the spleen, so that you can dump up to almost two pints of red blood cells right back into the bloodstream, so you're not an anemic.

.

(29) Toxic Sperm
[2009],[Attendee]

Sperm

[Aajonus]

You can use sperm, but if he's got that much metal toxicity up on his head, he probably has it around the other head too.

[Attendees]

Laughs.

[Aajonus]

That sperm may not be so good.

Your sperm smells metallic, don't use it.

If it smells like it smells like an old iron, it's full of toxic minerals, don't wanna use it.

.

(30) Toxins In Water
[2009],[Attendee]

I'll give like a pain where I think our spleens supposed to be or like in the corner

[Aajonus]

Spleen?

Yeah.

[Attendee]

And so, I don't know what that is.

And it started after I was detoxing, now I'm getting better it started to come on, like I'm getting in the bathtub and all of a sudden I have this pain where it's just like doubled over there, but water triggers it.

Not drinking it, it's just being around water or even the running of a water.

You don't have any idea what that might be.

[Aajonus]

I can take a wild guess say you're allergic to water and the body's just warning you?

[Attendee]

The chemicals in the water maybe.

[Aajonus]

Could be the chemicals in the water?

LA, there are 193 chemicals in the water.

When I used to live in LA, in the city, LA whether it was Beverly Hills or Venice or Laurel Canyon, when I lived in those three places.

I would get into the bath with nothing in it, I would be out in seven minutes, trembling, shaking, passing out.

That's how toxic it was.

So, I learned that I had to put milk, vinegar, and sea salt in the water, certain amount of it to control that.

[Attendee #2]

Why sea salt, but you are opposed to salt.

You're putting sea salt in in the water?

[Aajonus]

Taking it internally if you take it internally.

Do you know the salt is more explosive than nitroglycerin.

?

(31) What Aajonus Is Eating
[2009],[Attendee]

Aajonus, are you stuffing yourself

I mean, are you eating like crazy to add the nutrients to there?

[Aajonus]

I'm eating double the butter that I usually eat, but you have to understand this is taking a lot of nutrients?

[Attendee]

I see that.

[Aajonus]

I mean, that's a lot of nutrients.

I'm losing blood and serum constantly.

The swelling in here, the whole taking care of this cap and that whole toxic insulin, my ankle's, everywhere.

Now this one's doing it too.

I eat tremendous amounts.

I eat almost double what I usually eat, double the meat, double the fat, everything.

If I didn't, I would be ultra skinny.

.

(32) Where To Live
[2009],[Attendee]

I'm almost retirement age, 66, and I'm ready to get outta here

Where do I go.

You travel all over the world, where is a good place to go?

[Aajonus]

It all depends upon your comfort level?

I'm comfortable in poverty.

[Attendee]

What does poverty mean.

[Aajonus]

Poverty means I don't need anything, but the food on the land?

[Attendee]

Is that in the local land or.

[Aajonus]

No running water?

I've got a river waterfall, I'm happy.

[Attendee]

So, where in the world else should we start with.

[Aajonus]

Depends on your comfort level, what can you live with and live without?

[Attendee]

Give me some names so we can start investigating, iI don't know.

[Attendee #2]

But do you wanna grow your own food.

Cows?

Is that's what you're talking about?

[Attendee]

No, no, we're not?

Come on.

That's what he talking about.

into the group.

[Attendee #2]

I don't mind the Theia thing where there's a group.

How many more communities are like that around the world that you know about.

[Aajonus]

None?

[Attendee #2]

That's the only one.

[Attendee #3]

There are some people in Asheville, South Carolina, wherever Asheville is?

[Aajonus]

They don't really have it together so much.

[Attendee #3]

I haven't been there in a while, that's the only other one I heard of.

[Aajonus]

It's cold there, it snows there.

[Attendee #2]

Go live with the Amish.

[Aajonus]

Do what Dennis does in Pangaea.

He bought the land, he built the place and then he invites people to come and they work the land.

They do everything for him and he gets the food that they grow and they cut when they harvest.

[Attendee]

Well, I have been emailing that and I can certainly use an engineer.
