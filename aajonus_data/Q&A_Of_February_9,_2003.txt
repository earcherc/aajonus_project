(1) Fat Vs Protein Cancer Reversal
[2005],[Aajonus]

As I said in the first book, 65% of my cases of cancer reverse with fats alone

Using proteins alone, very few of them.

So, fats a major issue with almost all disease, even cancer, it's important.

So, remember that if you've got toxins in your body, when you have cancer, you're gonna build up a lot of toxins everywhere in the body and it's a breakdown the liver.

The liver's not digesting fats properly to make the cholesterols bind and to dissolve dead cells, so they just keep collecting the body.

So, you're in a dangerous situation.

Fats are so important to bind with those poisons, dissolve those poisons.

If you don't have them, guess where the poisons go, right into the cells.

You can do damage to chromosomes, may not recover.

Then people do not recover.

People who stay thin do not recover.

Owanza would go from 82 pounds when she was vomiting and vomiting and vomiting and starting to discharge tumors, but as soon as that cycle was over, I didn't think she was gonna live five times, but she made it through.

5' 2" and 82 pounds.

No, she went down to 68 pounds.

A teenager, 12 years old.

Then she would gain all this weight, up to 140, 160 pounds.

So, she would put it on when she had to.

People who reverse their illnesses quickest on this diet, allow themselves to get fat.

Those who don't, move very slowly, especially actresses because they want to stay slim.

Sure, their blood will stay stable and they'll have more energy, but when they have a breakdown in detoxification, they don't get through it easily, and don't recover easily, it lingers because they don't have that excess fat to protect them, so it starts damaging your cells.

Life cells, weakens them, makes them irritable.

So, fat is the most important, all fat.

If it's a disease mainly dealing with the nerve tissue, cream is the best.

If it's dealing with any other part of the body, butter is better.

.

(2) Fresh Vs Rotten Meat
[2005],[Attendee]

What are the specific benefits from the three different types of kind of high meat

Fish, fowl, and beef?

[Aajonus]

The fish helps replace the inner elements, the constituents of nerve tissue the best The fowl helps the nerve lining, the sheath, the intestines, the bones, the bone cartilage, lymphatic system, any of the white glands, connective tissue, the skin.

Red meat helps blood, the dark glands, liver, gallbladder, spleen, bone marrow and muscles.

So, if you eat the high beef, it will help break down, dissolve the degenerative tissue those particular systems.

[Attendee]

Would the same apply to glands and stuff like that.

[Aajonus]

That will concentrate on that gland, and other glands.

The fresh will help rebuild it and the high will help get rid of degenerative tissue in those systems.

Okay.

[Attendee #2]

Will high meat help rebuild.

[Aajonus]

It'll help rebuild only in that it helps break down that tissue to be replaced?

A lot of people can't break it down.

If they can't break it down, they can't replace it.

Because cooked food destroys all the bacteria, all the natural elements in parasites in every animal cell, and once you cook it, you destroy all of that, so your body doesn't have that natural ability to just have a recycling going on in the ecological system.

Balanced ecological system.

By eating the high meats you're replenishing all of that.

Just put it in jars, and if you have it in a cooler, just change the ice.

.

(3) Gain Or Lose Not Heavy Enough
[2005],[Attendee]

Before I gained like 34 pounds, and then I started experimenting with the weight loss bit

I gained 34, but I noticed since the time that I started- it didn't happen all the sudden, I started losing the excess fat that was in my body, and especially the last one I started to get so stressed out.

My libido was really down, it just changed me.

Before I was feeling like really happy, I started fighting the person I was involved with and it was just such a change just from doing that.

So, my question was, instead of doing the weight loss, should I just stay the same.

[Aajonus]   When people are thin, I never suggest that they go on a weight loss?

I don't care if it takes five years.

[Attendee]   Even after 34 pounds.

[Aajonus]   No, she gained fine, but I'm talking about some other people?

You just keep pushing and pushing, pushing until they finally develop.

Again, the reason for that is if you don't have excess fat and you have poisons in the body, you always have poisons in the body, that'll go into the fat instead of your live active cells.

You don't want them there cause that's gonna cause damage.

Continue on the weight gain.

You're still too thin.

You're not even up to your lowest.

You've got 10 more pounds, and then from there at least 12, 15 pounds above that, then think about going on a weight loss.

It takes time.

Sometimes the liver's just not well enough to be able to digest and handle the fats or you're so toxic that your body's using all the fats to detoxify and burn.

We're talking about thin people; we're not talking about fat people.

Those fat people are still healthier because the toxins are going into their fat and they're not damaging their cells.

They're not feeding those live cells very well, but at least they're protecting them with all that fat.

And let me tell you, the people who are happier and more level headed are the people who are obese that come to me and go on the diet.

People who are very thin are the ones that are basket cases.

[Attendee]   Even if they got fat from like carbs.

[Aajonus]   Even if it's from that, those fats still bind with those poisons.

[Attendee #2]   They're not the healthiest.

[Aajonus]   No, no, no.

I'm saying usually the person has more equilibrium.

[Attendee]   Is there a point where it can be bad.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, it can be, if you don't have enough proteins and you're damaging your cells?

Yeah, definitely.

If you're not feeding the heart protein and you've got all this excess.

weight.

You're putting stress on the heart.

You'll damage it.

.

(4) Herbs
[2005],[Aajonus]

Well, it depends upon

If herbs are fresh and you juice them, they're very potent, full of enzymes, vitamins, everything's packed in.

Once you dry it, everything's dead.

You get some minerals from it, you can get some other chemical products from it, but it won't be in a balance.

That's why I said in the book, if you're gonna make, make a sun tea with it if it's an emergency type thing, otherwise we're in Southern California, get your herbs fresh and juice them.

But if you're having an herb that is concentrated, other than parsley or salary, make sure you only have 5% of your juices.

Cilantro pulls out a lot of metals.

[Attendee]   What about herbal extracts.

[Aajonus]   They're all processed?

Processed, distilled, solvent extracted; alcohol may be the solvent or petroleum, like brake fluid.

[Attendee #2]   Cause they talk about the probiotics as a friendly bacteria, which is kind of like the herb that is also dry and not alive.

[Aajonus]   Is it dried.

[Attendee #2]   If it's in a powdered form, it's dried?

[Aajonus]   That's right.

It's not active, and not alive and it will take a lot for your body to rehydrate that herb just to get a little bit of something out of it.

Remember, we don't have those enzymes to break down cellulose  Our enzymes and digestive juices are for meats, for animal protein.

Takes an herbivore to break down those herbs, vegetation.

.

(5) How To Get Kids On Primal
[2005],[Aajonus]

It's my house, and I have to deal with your emotions

Help me help you.

And that's what I tell all my parents.

I have parents that went through a heavy change with their children and every mother that's gotten their children to do it 25% within a year, they're 50% within another year, they're 75% because the kids naturally move toward them.

But you have to start them giving them one meal a day.

You think they're gonna go somewhere else rather than be with you over that.

But we're not talking about raw meat, we're talking about raw milkshakes?

Now I got all the evidence in the book prove that raw milk is a benefit, not a harm.

Pasteurized milk is a harm.

As long as you force them to eat least one good raw meal a day with egg and cream, it will help them.

And you'll see, they'll adjust as you go along, then you can make meat too.

Like most of the parents that I have, they force them to have the milkshake in the morning ana milkshake at night.

That is it.

They have to do it.

If they don't like it, they can go live in the street.

You can see the adjustment, it's a big difference.

.

(6) Milk Swelling & Mucus - Clabber
(7) Nudity In France - Lots Of Cream & Butter Lets Them Drink Wine
can tell

They had had quite a few children and their breasts were like I see in late twenties, early thirties here, and they're 50, 60, 80 years old?

It was just amazing too.

There were girls that going around selling clothes on the beach and they would just take everything off and just right there, they don't have any of these bare body hang-ups and, they'll just strip completely bear, testicles and everything and change right on the beach.

It's only for a few seconds, but there's no red reluctance about it, no fear, there's no anxiety, there's no hostility.

Everybody does it.

It was so refreshing to be in that kind of a culture.

[Attendee]   How much butter, fat or cream do you have to have before you drink wine.

[Aajonus]   Laughs I'm not suggesting it?

Cream and butter before your drink it.

They usually drink the wine before eating their dish, it's also got heavy cream or butter in the dish.

[Attendee #2]   All raw.

[Aajonus]   Well, not anymore?

Well, let me put it this way.

There are a lot of French chefs that use raw still.

They still use raw.

France was the easiest place for me to get raw cream, raw butter, and raw milk.

[Attendee #2]   So, there's actually a French style restaurant in this new shopping center called Grove, and in there they have a list of 30 or 40 different raw milk cheeses.

[Kathy]   Are they salted.

[Aajonus]   It either has to be pasteurized or salted?

[Attendee]   Why do they like having the salt and why are they okay if it has salt.

[Aajonus]   The salt is an anti-bacterial?

[Attendee #2]   Is the answer fat and sun.

[Aajonus]   Fat and sun?

Also, if women will do an exercise like you do a counter like this one, everybody can see.

And if you spread your arms down like this and you don't go too far, and you go like this and breathe the circulation in to the mammary glands, and it isn't hard.

[Attendee]   How many can you do.

[Aajonus]   As many as you want?

When you start feeling it, you know that the rush of circulation is going in there, will start breaking down dead cells that cause sagging, and it'll strengthen the muscles in there.

I've seen girls go from sagging down here to go to a full 2.

5" up, doing that every day.

Not at one time, they may do 10 at a time, 5 times a day.

.

(8) Nut Formula In Fridge
[2003],[Attendee]

Well, my question is centered around this nut formula, which I think is fantastic, once or twice is really great, and if I make too much of it, is there anything wrong with just putting in a jar with a lid on it and putting in the fridge

[Aajonus]

Yes?

Don't put it in fridge, leave it out.

[Attendee]

For a couple days.

[Aajonus]

I'd left it out for as much as a week?

Never refrigerate eggs.

When you put eggs in the refrigerator, it lowers the bacteria level and the enzyme activity.

Usually, if you eat raw eggs that have been refrigerated, you get undigested proteins into the blood, and that's toxic.

As long as you get them you can leave them out.

the bacteria will grow again, and the enzymes will develop.

[Attendee]

How long do you have to leave them out.

[Aajonus]

Usually 24 hours, unless you put it in warm water?

If you put it in warm water to warm up, maybe an hour, two hours.

[Attendee]

Can I leave them in the cupboard.

[Aajonus]

No, it's if they're refrigerated and you want to eat them right away?

Take this cold refrigerated egg and put in bowl of warm water and you let it sit for a couple of hours.

[Attendee]

So, if I have excess, just put it in a jar and set it somewhere out of the sunlight.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

.

(9) Preserving Food With Ice Block
[2003],[Aajonus]

Do you have a car

That's the easiest?

When I have a rental car, not a hotel, I take one of those big plastic coolers.

I put a block of ice in there.

I block of ice will last four days.

So, I don't have to change the ice every day  But in a car, you got big that plastic cooler with that big block, seven-pound block and drain out some of the water every day, but you don't want the ice, you want the block.

[Attendee]   How do you get the block.

[Aajonus]   Every supermarket here caries it, most of your liquor stores have blocks?

[Attendee]   It's harder to get blocks.

[Aajonus]   Every place I've gone to I've gotten them in the last past three years.

[Attendee]   You can form the ice to the food.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, but you don't want to form them?

You don't want it to touch the food because they can burn the food.

[Attendee]   The ice.

[Aajonus]   It doesn't matter if the ice is packed right against it, it can burn the food.

Put ice against you in a cooler and see what happens to your skin.

[Attendee]   I wouldn't even wanna be in a cooler.

[Aajonus]   Laughs  So, a block works very well, and there hasn't been a place that I've seen all the way across this country that doesn't sell a block of ice.

At 7-11, they have the choice.

They don't have many of the blocks, they have a lot of the crushed ice or the ice cubes, but they all have the blocks.

Just have to ask them.

You saw me on RIpleys Believe It or Not, I ate it for 1 year and 3 months.

The last six months it wasn't even in a cooler, it was on my back porch.

No cooling at all.

[Attendee #2]   But you only eat a little bit of it, right.

[Aajonus]   You know how much I eat on that fricking show?

Usually, I eat just a little bit, went on that show, had a full cup.

Cause they had me eating so much.

[Attendee #2]   Did you detox.

[Aajonus]   It didn't cause me to detox?

[Attendee #2]   It might be for somebody else, right.

[Aajonus]   Don't know?

Might.

but you don't want eat that there, but she's saying she had like a full meal or something.

[Jim]   Is a golf ball size the right amount.

[Aajonus]   Well, it depends upon the individual, anywhere from a ping-pong sized ball to a golf ball?

[Attendee]   I just chop the meat up and let it dry out.

It smells for a minute, and I just carry it in my pocket.

[Aajonus]   That's not as healthy.

[Attendee]   What do you mean that's not as healthy.

[Aajonus]   Because it's starting to dehydrate, destroying a lot of the enzymes, and bacteria once it's dehydrated?

That's why the Eskimos and the American Indians, when they made pemmican, they didn't eat it unless they had to because dried meat is not something they like because it wouldn't help regenerate cells.

Would give them energy and help them maintain and last, but it would not cause them to thrive.

So, they would make a big batch of pemmican every year, if they didn't eat it by the spring time, they buried it.

Jar in a dark cupboard.

Or put it in a container and put it in your car, then it's very delicious.

[Attendee #2]   You don't put your meat in the refrigerator.

[Aajonus]   The night before I'll take it out and put it in the cupboard or I'll put it in my car, so it can be very warm by the time I go to eat it?

If it's cold it's flat, it's tasteless, but warm, especially really warm.

.

(10) Radiation Treatments Cause Food Acidic
[2003],[Attendee],[unclear]

All meats have salt in it and because I'm so sensitive to salt that even if I have a little bit of , red meat especially, chicken

I don't need to use sauces cause I thought it was the sauces that made my mouth burn, but it's the meats with the salt, they burn my mouth.

[Aajonus]   That's the acidic minerals in the meats.

[Attendee]   Other people eat a lot of it and they don't get bothered by it.

[Aajonus]   That's because they didn't have radiation therapy.

Radiation therapy causes everything to go twice as acidic, the city, and even transforms some of the naturally alkalinizing minerals into acid minerals.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   That's why everything I eat-

That's why every time you eat something, you start discharging more of poisons out the gums out, out the tongue, the lips.

[Attendee]   And my whole body starts itching too.

[Aajonus]   Same thing with mine.

Like I said, I used to have cracks this long, all the way down to here.

My mouth was just bleeding, cracks all the way up into here.

You see some scars.

[Attendee]   But you continued eating it, even though you had these symptoms.

[Aajonus]   There's no way to stop it?

I just constantly put cold cream in my mouth just to soothe myself.

[Attendee]   So, I'm not not going eliminate eating chicken, beef, and fish.

[Aajonus]   If you do, you're not going to get well.

[Attendee]   So continue.

Keep on trucking on?

[Aajonus]   Yeah, mine was a little bit worse than yours, you're gonna have heavy buildup of dead cells, dead tissue here from the dryness?

Generally, the cracking.

I had the chemotherapy.

It said damages cells, it damages the vitamin K, and vitamin, so it prevents proper clotting.

.

(11) Rubber Water Bottles
[2003],[Attendee]

You said about the hot water bottle, can I put it right in this area

[Aajonus]

Because Basal Cell cancer is very acidic, if you put it here, it might start burning because it'll perspire with it?

So, it's better to have it over here.

[Attendee]

Okay, that's where it actually feels better.

I put it on my ear, it feels so good.

I put it here and I'm uncomfortable.

[Aajonus]

I had the same problem when I had cancer on my face.

Well, I don't like these because it's a synthetic material.

I just found a company that actually makes rubber water bottles.

So, it takes a lot more heat without falling apart.

Especially Laurie, Laurie likes to have those things cooking, and it says 140 degrees max, she put 160 degrees in there.

Burn her self They're all rubber, smell like rubber, of course, and they smell like burned rubber when you first put hot water in them.

So, what I do is I'll fill them up a couple times and leave them outside for about three weeks before I use them to cut down on the rubber, but it just smells like a rubber tire at first.

.

(12) Salt Cravings & Edema
[2003],[Attendee]

When I drink juice, a lot of celery, I get pretty bloated and I noticed sodium does that for me too

So, I don't know if this has to do with sodium.

[Aajonus]   Were you a big salt eater.

[Attendee]   I never crave salt, but I definitely liked salt?

[Aajonus]   Usually that occurs in people who have an allergy to sodium, salt, and it stores in their body from all the years of adding having had the salt.

So, you have all these salt storages throughout the system, crystals, and whenever you take the sodium in the celery juice, it starts breaking it up.

So, it causes edema.

And the reason it costs edema is because you'll have a clumping of sodium ion, and when the sodium clumps, passes the cell, cells eat by ionization, they have 1 to 2 ions as their stomach.

When they need to eat, they'll track, let's say a potassium ion, which can carry some glucagon or glycogen with it and they can get sugar that way.

Sodium usually carries H20 with it, so if the cell opens to draw in some sodium to get the H20 and clumping, the magnetism of the ion cell is so great that it rips the ion, magnetizes the ion and rips the guts out of the cell.

Cell shrivels like a raisin and all this excess fluid stays in the blood serum and does not get into the cells.

And that causes the edema.

[Attendee]   That's from salt or celery.

[Aajonus]   That's from the salt in your body, sodium pulling the salts out, getting recycled into the blood, and then it would be done?

[Attendee]   And what happens to that cell.

[Aajonus]   That cell is dead?

[Attendee]   So, if you're drinking a celery juice, it shrivels up the cell.

[Aajonus]   Well, it can?

The body will usually regulate itself.

That's normally what happens when you put salt in the body.

If you're using high sodium foods like tomatoes, watermelon, celery juice, which is high in sodium.

It doesn't cause a clumping even though it's concentrated in sodium.

It'll start pulling that out.

When that happens, very few cells are affected that way with the clumping cause the celery juice, or tomato juice, watermelon juice will keep it from clustering.

[Attendee]   So, is it healing the damage somehow.

[Aajonus]   Well, when it comes out, the body will try to keep the salt from clumping, try to disperse it and then throw it out kidneys?

Some will be perspired if you exercise, some of them be gotten rid of that way.

[Attendee]   So, is it better to continue doing this or sort of cut back on it.

[Aajonus]   Are you discomforted by it?

[Attendee]   Well, it's not painful or anything, but I can't wear my clothes?

[Aajonus]   Then do a hot bath or exercise and perspire it off, but the quicker you get it out of your body.

Salt storages in the body cause the worst cravings.

Can cause you to have cravings for candy, carbohydrates, starches, starch carbohydrates, more water, all kinds of salt imbalances, the whole chemistry.

[Attendee]   So, celery, tomato, and watermelon to flush that out.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, but if you have watermelon, you better eat a lot of cream, if you're having tomatoes, you also have some cream That way, if the sodium ions are clumping, the fats there to bind and reduces magnetism?

[Attendee]   So, have cream every time you have tomatoes.

[Aajonus]   I'm not saying that.

I'm saying most of the time.

[Attendee #2]   What about butter.

[Aajonus]   That works?

Just not as well.

[Attendee #3]   What about yogurt.

[Aajonus]   That would be okay?

.

(13) Teeth Fillings Damage
[2003],[Attendee]

I was told I need a filling and I asked the guy about it and he said if I let it go the bacteria will eat through and eventually get your nerve, and I think you have a different opinion about that, but my thought was

If you have something wrong with the tooth already, is it the same theory that the bacteria is doing something to that already damage material or is the bacteria actually eating away at the tooth.

[Aajonus]   Well, you've asked a very large subject?

I'm not gonna go into it fully.

If you have, let's say composite, which is plastic.

It sets off dioxins and phthalates.

It causes bacteria to grow underneath, also causes a recession of gum, also causes a recession of nerves.

Composites are not good things to put plastic fillings.

Get inlays or onlays or ceramic.

Those are the things to use.

[Attendee]   Crowns.

[Aajonus]   They only make that in crowns?

[Attendee]   But there's metal under there.

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

That's to reinforce.

[Attendee]   That's okay.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

It's gold.

You should ask for gold.

[Attendee #2]   You can get gold or you can get a combination of gold and platinum, which is stronger than the gold alone.

[Aajonus]   Composites are not good.

And of course, if you have amalgam fillings, that's 50% mercury, and that poisons the nerve all the way back.

I had all my albums removed in 1978.

They left all my teeth grey, there wasn't tooth in my head.

I've only seen young people repair their teeth on this diet.

You're so toxic, it takes 40 years to get well.

Teeth are the hardest place to repair.

You have no circulation going on the outside.

The only way you can feed is from within?

Bones on the inside, it takes 7.

5 years to replace every cell in the bone 5x.

But you've got circulation coming from every direction in teeth.

You don't have that restorative ability.

[Attendee #2]   What about the nerves surrounding them.

[Aajonus]   Well, they can be severely damaged from all the mercury in amalgams?

Yeah, that just shows that your nerves are not strong yet.

Now, all my teeth dangled after the chemo and radiation.

It's deteriorated all of the bone around my teeth, so my teeth just dangled, very sensitive and sore.

If I went like that, I'd lose half a cup of blood at a time.

So, I had to drink everything through a straw and they wanted to pull all my teeth, and I said, "Well, I'm gonna die in a few months".

21 years old, I wasn't going to do it.

It took years, but the raw cheese really helped me stabilize.

Basically, it's my cheese cake: half butter, half cheese, little bit more butter than cheese sometimes.

And after about a year and a half, bones grew back, stabilized within the last six years.

I still have most of my teeth.

I'd say I have one here missing and this is deteriorated.

That one's taken 20 years to deteriorate.

No decay.

Every time I go to the dentist, there's no decay there.

It's just that the acid keeps dissolving the tooth cause it's open.

There's no dentine to stop the acids in my mouth from breaking it down.

.

(14) Vacation
[2003],[Aajonus]

This time instead of going into Q&A, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my experience on vacation

I went to Guadeloupe, which is an island in the West Indies.

It's French owned and French speaking.

They speak Creo and French there, no English like somebody's from Montreal.

So, it's very difficult to find anybody to speak English.

I don't speak French well enough to have any conversation about nutrition.

So, that's why I went there and I would be assured to have a vacation  It worked; it was a fun time.

One day, I went to go hiking, on Guadeloupe it's like two islands flooded together and one is called Grande-Terre and the other's called Bastard.

So, every time you say it you say bastard, but it's Basse-Terre, but in French, it's called Basse-Terre, but it sounds like you star with a hard r.

So, it's bastard and Grande-Terre.

The Grande-Terre, it's very hilly, lots of hills and valleys, so I drove all through that and it was nice.

The other island is where the volcano is.

It's not an active volcano and jungle all around it, and mainly on these two islands the Grande-Terre is mainly sugarcane.

The other island is mainly coffee, and bananas.

So, it's heavily farmed, but it's gorgeous.

So, I was going to go on the natural human path, which is just cut through, it's pretty rocky and messy, and I went with these rubber tongs and in my shorts and a t-shirt and I was going on this road and I just didn't want to be on the road anymore.

So, I started going to the animal trails.

That's rough cause you have to go under, and you have to climb over these groups of big, tall roots.

Tall ceiling and then falling over them.

It was wonderful, and I actually spent about five hours climbing through the jungle trying to find the waterfall, and finally got to it and there were a couple of people on the diet who were professional rock climbers and, they forced me to go up.

So, I went, it was okay, but I was always afraid of Heights, and since the stomach surgery, I've always been nauseous from heights, but something came over me and I climbed all the way down the falls and then all the way down the lower falls.

A rock lining all the way, it's phenomenally with these palms.

And how many times they broke, they were well made tongs, their actual rubber, never find anything like that in the United States.

And I had one of those Swiss army knives, so they have 28 tools.

So, I was able to punch it back through, and I had only banged up my nails and looked at my nails, I had a few cuts on my toes.

But it was pretty easy.

It was pretty good, and I was just so amazed that I was able to do that.

And then the last day I was there, they had a thing called cirque, which means circus, and they have trapeze.

I turn 56 in 2 months, and I get up there on the trapeze, about 30 feet or so high.

You pull the trapeze over and I'm nauseous as hell.

I got up there and I was very nauseous and I said, I'm gonna have to stand here until the nausea goes.

If the nausea doesn't go, I'm not jumping, just trapped.

So, I waited about five, six minutes, the nausea went away, and then of course, when I had to hang out and grab the thing, the nausea came back.

So, I stood there for a good two minutes and knew what they had me strapped on the bungee cords on the side, couldn't be a terrible accident.

The only thing that was a rude awakening is it's right near the equation and it's only about 500 miles north of Venezuela, and it was very humid.

I was perspiring like crazy when I was going through the jungle and of course I was drinking the water coming from the stream.

There are these signs, photograph signs showing the snail with this parasite that goes here to man, and what it causes, don't drink this water.

I didn't seem to get any, I drank probably two liters of that water, but I had to drink more water.

I drank probably four liters in the last three days that I was there and that's how much I drank in the whole year here or at least through the fall and winter.

So, that vegetable juice was very important.

So, the next time I go on a trip like that, I would definitely take my juice with me, so I don't have to drink the water because at the end of that, I got home, I found my teeth very sensitive.

Other people won't react as much as I do because I normally don't drink water, but water's very leaching, like I said.

And I took lots of cream with me.

I couldn't get any red meat, I had little lamb chops a couple times, but there's no red meat on that island unless it's frozen.

Fresh fish every day right off the dock, and I had it in my rental car, not even wrapped tightly, not in the jar or plastic bag, sitting in the back.

I had big swordfishes there, and they're just cutting them up right there in big chunks, but I'm used to having a lot of red meat, and I had only a couple of lamb chops there, as far as meat.

I was there for seven days.

I did have some of the New Zealand beef, one quart jar of it, and I didn't eat it until I had to, about the sixth day there, and it was just like fresh.

I had it in the hotel room with ice on it, change the ice every day.

I turned refrigeration off, air conditioning off because I don't like air conditioning and I don't worry about mosquitos because I only got bit three times while I was there and I slept on the beach.

I just liked having a hotel room.

I went to Club Met.

They knew who you are.

Can always find somebody that speaks English there if you need to, and to always fall back.

If nobody knows you, and you don't speak the language well, and something happens.

It could be difficult to get help.

It was very enjoyable, but I would definitely take more red meat with me in the future.

And I did take enough cream, I took 8 ounces a day for the entire seven days and a little bit of sour cream.

I forgot my cheese in Florida, that would save my lower mineral problem.

I had plenty of butter, had everything I needed.

I took my primal facial body care cream, which I use for sunscreen when it's hot, closer to the sun in the winter, 3 million miles closer to the sun, so it's much more intense.

That's why in south America, when it's summer there, it's much hotter than it is here in the summer.

So, it's very intense sun.

The one day that I didn't put it on before I went out to the beach, and got into a salt water beach, which rips the fats off the skin.

That two-hour period that I spent in the ocean water, I burned.

[Attendee]   Why.

[Aajonus]   Because i didn't use the primal facial body care cream?

[Attendee #2]   What were the girls like.

[Aajonus]   Well, natives have been moved off of all the islands, except for one, just like in Hawaii?

True natives' who belong to those West Indian islands were put on an island.

Most the black people lived there who were slaves and Eastern Indians, so those are the two cultures there.

And you talked about minorities, whites are minority.

You're lucky if you're 5% percent of the population.

They're very sociable and nice until you start going back into where they live and then it's not a very nice place, just like why are you driving in my neighborhood.

(15) Weight Gain & Water Weight
[2003],[Aajonus]

Five more pounds is going to make a big difference, most likely

What I suggest people do is to be on a good healthy diet for six months before you try to lose the old toxic fat just so you can stabilize the system.

Well, most women like you will gain water weight.

As the body starts going in and cleaning out, more circulation, more fluid required.

So, it's not more fat.

It's just temporary water weight.

[Attendee]

It's so difficult for me to eat fat.

[Aajonus]

That means your liver is in pretty bad shape, so eat more cream for a while, which causes water retention and have some butter.

[203],[Attendee]

Any movements like Tai Chi or yoga or stuff like that that claims to open up certain channels, how does that actually work

[Aajonus]

Okay?

If we're not mobile and we've got congestion in the system, you can get all kinds of nerve networks that will clog.

It's like having a bridge that gets overgrown, it starts falling apart and it's no longer utilizable.

When you start doing movements, it brings the circulation in, and if you're eating properly, you can rebuild those bridges, those canals faster from doing those Tai Chi, moving, yoga, any of them.

[Attendee]

Are they better than just normal exercise, you know, running around and playing sports or something like that.

[Aajonus]

Depends on what sport you're doing?

When you're lifting weights, same position, it's not as good.

[Attendee]

So, just general exercise is probably better than aerobic exercise.

Is that what you're saying.

[Aajonus]

Whatever your enjoyment is, whatever you enjoy doing as your exercise, that's the exercise?

Then you want to achieve something more than doing something else, and hopefully you'll like it.
