Everybody will be able to take care of themselves if I give everybody enough information.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death­cap mushroom­ poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body.
