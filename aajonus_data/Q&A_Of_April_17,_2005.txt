(1) Aajonus Are One Popcorn In 7 Years
(2) Aajonus Drink & Uric ACid From Exercise & Sore
[2004],[Attendee]

What are you drinking

[Aajonus]   This is a mixture of hard green pineapple, cucumber, honey, lemon juice, coconut cream, coconut oil, eggs, and honey?

[Attendee #2]   You drink that every day.

[Aajonus]   No?

Once in a while.

So, what do it for is just to help dissolve dead cells, and also, I'll get relieved.

Let's say I'm detoxing heavily, and I feel sore and bruised all over that's because I don't have enough vitamin C and the other citric acids to help break down that toxicity and relieve it from the body.

So, if I eat that my soreness and stiffness will go away after the detox.

You know, like you have a cold or flu when it's over, you're saying, oh my God, I feel stiff.

That's because you're low in citric acid and other nutrients that can help dissolve neutralize the uric acid.

When you're exercising the same thing, you're not used to exercising and then you get stiff, it's because of uric acid and other byproducts of burning fuel, utilizing fuel and energy stores in the body and causes a buildup that causes the soreness.

[Kathy]   How much do you use.

[Aajonus]   I use?

.

.

1 cup of pineapple

2 cups of cucumber

1 tablespoon of coconut oil (fermented coconut oil),

5 - 3 ounces of coconut cream

2 ounces of honey

3 tablespoons of lemon juice.

[Kathy]   How do you ferment the coconut oil.

[Aajonus]   That's the way it comes?

The one you buy from James, it's fermented coconut oil.

The only thing he has is coconut oil that's fermented.

[Attendee #2]   Is that the coconut cream.

[Aajonus]   No, coconut oil isn't refrigerated?

It looks like Crisco oil, unless it's warm like today, then It'll be liquid.

[Attendee #2]   Essentially, do you need all that.

Let's say, you're exercising, you got aches?

Is it just the vitamin C you need.

So, if you had like an orange and some cream?

[Aajonus]   You don't have the fats, and the reason I use the cucumber is because it's got a lot of silica in it, which helps the skin and tissues relax and cool?

So, if you've got the acids in there, the vitamin C, not just the vitamin C, the other acid here involved in citrus, if you want to break down the substances, you need minerals to help bind with those toxins.

Plus you need the fats to arrest those poisons, so they don't get reabsorbed.

So that's why the whole formula all together.

[Kathy]   So, every time you go exercising.

[Aajonus]   No, that's if you start getting sore, that means you're getting depleted in certain nutrients that this could provide?

I went through a massive brain detox for the past three years, and it got to the point where my neck was getting so stiff and sore and it wasn't reacting, and I started getting sore on the right side.

So, then I started drinking that and within a day it was relieving incrementally, but I only eat that maybe when I'm going through a time of stiffness and soreness.

[Attendee #2]   Do you put the whole cucumber.

[Aajonus]   If it's organic I put the whole cucumber, the peel and all?

.

(3) Aajonus Tapeworm
[2005],[Aajonus]

So it's a delicate balance

[Attendee]   When you said you got a parasite in your body, how do you know you had one there.

[Aajonus]   I started passing it in my feces?

[Attendee]   You can see it.

[Aajonus]   Oh yeah?

[Attendee]   What does it look like.

[Aajonus]   It was a tapeworm?

I passed 25 feet of it one day and 30 feet of it another day, but I saw parts of it passing for about four months, and then all of a sudden it finished its work, and within two weeks I had dumped the whole thing.

[Attendee]   Did you catch it.

[Aajonus]   Oh yeah, I caught it?

[Attendee #2]   Was it still alive.

[Aajonus]   Oh, no?

Once it's out of the body, it doesn't survive.

You get these little links, like some kind of pasta.

It looked like pasta, you let them sit and dry up.

They just disappear.

They just completely disappear, and there's this very teeny, little thing, you know, they could get in the dirt anywhere.

.

(4) Abortion, Oil In Vagina
[2005],[Attendee]

What's a safer alternative for abortion

Don't worry mom, it's not?

.

.

[Aajonus]   Your son's pregnant! Laughs  When you're on this diet, abortion is difficult because the body is so healthy.

The only way that I've suggested, and that's worked with people who've been on the diet awhile is putting pennyroyal oil, but you have to take a scientific tube that allows just just a very fine passage in there, and you have to insert that through the cervix where the oil and you have to blow it inside of you.

You have to scratch.

It's not a sharp glass, but it's a glass tube that has a center it with a very fine flow.

So, you can only get maybe 10 drops in this whole thing, but you're only going to get probably five in there, five or six, and that's all you need.

Then when it gets down to the cervix, you feel that it's hit, you know, through the cervix you can feel it hit the wall because the ovaries discharge only one per month, fertilizes eggs.

So, let's say it's happening on the right side.

Then those eggs go down the fallopian tube, down to where they need meet the sperm, and they go right up into that surface and that's where they latch on.

So, if you scratch, then we get to the mucus lining, and it absorbs that pennyroyal oil.

You'll usually have abortion pretty readily, but with lots of labor pain, most of the time, lots of labor pain.

So, it usually happens in 3-8 days.

That's the only sure way that I know that works 90% of the time.

[Attendee]   And where can get pennyroyal oil at.

[Aajonus]   It's almost illegal?

You have to get in Canada or somewhere like that.

It's illegal in this country for that reason.

You might be able to find it in some states, but in this state it's illegal.

.

(5) Acrylamides From Cooking Starch
[2004],[Aajonus]

And that was causing his cancer

Cancer can come from the accumulation of all kinds of different poisons.

The Country, a bunch of scientists there and full professors that are no longer full professors because they issued this particular report and put it out to the public before it was reviewed by the authorities that 80% of the cancer out there is because of acrylamides  Acrylamides form when you boil/cook something in oil.

Cereals, doughnuts, potato chips, any kind of chip, soy chips, french fries.

They cause the most cancer.

They wanted to outlaw these foods in Sweden.

[Attendee]   Vegetable oils, right.

Not animal fats?

[Aajonus]   Even animal fats?

If you're boiling something with high starch in it.

High carbohydrate along with the fat causes the problem.

Of course, it's worse with vegetable oils, but that's the problem.

It creates all these acrylamides, and that creates a lot of cancerous conditions.

All 12 of those professor's lost their tenures, because they went to the media before they let the university research their research.

Nobody's been able to scientifically disprove it.

You've got a lot of medical professionals out there and a lot of pseudo scientists that are arguing against their research, but nobody's coming up with scientific proof like they had the prof, but the cereal industry, those chip industries are trillions of dollars a year.

They're not going to let it happen.

So, heart condition.

If you read my second book, we talked about cholesterol is not a factor, that's a myth.

The cholesterol myth, get the book, "The Cholesterol Myth".

It identified 90% of all people who have heart attacks have heart attacks when they have low cholesterol levels, and when they got low blood pressure.

The medical profession wants you on drugs.

High blood pressure is very important.

If you got a cardiac problem, it's what keeps your arteries open.

If you've got a arterial problem or a venous problem, you need high blood pressure or else they cut off and you block circulation.

That's what happens with people when they take medication, they end up getting varicose veins, damaged arteries.

They get thrombosis, which are very enlarged vessels that just keep swelling.

All of those are created when you stop high blood pressure with medication.

Just remember the medical profession is run by the pharmaceutical industry and they want you to take medication every day and fill their pockets.

It's got nothing to do with you getting well.

So, they attack symptoms.

You having high blood pressure is not a symptom of that you should stop that symptom, that body has addressed high blood pressure activity to make sure that you can address your bad circulatory problem.

So, you need fats.

You need high blood pressure if you've got a history of those conditions, but you have to understand that if it's in your family, your family has a tendency to store toxicity in their veins, arteries, and their heart.

You just have to eat properly, so that you don't accumulate toxins, which you're going to store in your heart and artery.

.

(6) Aluminum Screens On Window
[2004],[Kathy]

When you're talking about aluminum again

Does that mean like aluminum screens on your window.

[Aajonus]

Even aluminum screens on your window will oxidize?

So, if you have somebody take them off, wash it once a year, right after summer, because summer is when they oxidize.

[Kathy]

So, when is it time that you should do with it.

[Aajonus]

You should do it in the fall, November?

[Kathy]

How about my screen door.

[Aajonus]

Same way, they need to be washed down?

So, the oxidized aluminum is off of it.

So, when the wind blows into your house, you're not breathing it in.

[Kathy]

I just worried because I have to remove every screen.

I see.

[Aajonus]

Well, for the windows, it's easier to remove them.

It's easy to wash them, but with the screen door.

You just close your other door and wash the screen door outside.

[Kathy]

Just with some good water.

[Aajonus]

Well, I would use a degreaser?

The Biokleen degreaser, and some water, that'll help break it down and remove it, and then hose it down.

[Kathy]

But the water hosing is chemical water.

[Aajonus]

There's no way to get around it?

[Kathy]

Can I put some water from advanced water and just put some vinegar in it.

[Aajonus]

Sure, if you want to?

It's expensive, but yeah.

That's the better way.

Absolutely.

You're industrious.

Yeah, well.

I have well water, so I don't have to worry about it.

[Kathy]

So.

it's in the fall I have to do it.

[Aajonus]

October, November, late October?

[Kathy]

What about now.

[Aajonus]

Well, you should go ahead and get it cleaned before we get the summer winds?

[Kathy]

Well, when should I start to clean it.

[Aajonus]

Right away, then October/November clean it again?

[Kathy]

October, November, and what other months.

[Aajonus]

That's all you need to do is once a year, right after the hot sunny season?

End of October - 1st of November.

But this year, since you didn't do it last October, November, go ahead and do it now, and then do it again in November.

.

(7) Alzheimers Caused By Aluminum
[2004],[Attendee]

I have a big question

[Aajonus]   This is the first person who says- everybody else says I got a little question.

[Attendees],[Attendees]   Laughs

The challenge is, on my father's side of the family.

They all suffer from Alzheimer's and I went with them to the doctor, and he said, "Don't eat fat, no fat.

", and then my my mother side, most of the people, they died with half attacks.

I'm trying to do all of these things my way.

What do you suggest, especially for Alzheimer's.

[Aajonus]   Alzheimer's is mainly caused from aluminum?

Aluminum destroys the Zetta potential.

The Zetta potential is the ability for nutrients to stay suspended in blood, lymph and neurological system.

What the aluminum does is it attracts the ions away from the protons.

So, all the older nutrients just sedimentate, they just drop.

So, that's what's happens in the blood and the neurological system.

Everything just becomes sediment.

That's what causes the brain not to work properly.

It's mainly aluminum.

If you go on the internet, you'll find out that they estimate at least 80% of Alzheimer's being caused by aluminum.

The other is probably mercury.

Since the 1960s aluminum is one of the biggest metals around, sliding doors, chairs, cooking utensils.

It's in vaccines.

Every time you get a vaccine, there's starting thimerosal, aluminum and formaldehyde in it.

[Kathy]   What about your screen doors.

You should take out the aluminum in the screen doors?

[Aajonus]   Even screen doors with aluminum?

It dusts.

As it oxidizes, it turns into a dust.

So, what happens is things turn into dust.

If you have a aluminum furniture, aluminum anything, it becomes dust, and you inhale it.

I remember last year when I was in Florida, I was seeing a man, and he had his daughter and his wife with them.

They were the reasons that he was with me for this console.

He had cancer metastasizing of the lungs, and I shot his irises and blew them up, and I said, you have more aluminum than I've ever seen in anybody, you know.

He was only against this?

He was only there because his daughter and his wife got him to go.

So, as soon as I said that about the aluminum, he you looked at his wife and his daughter and their eyebrows all raised.

He worked in an aluminum factory for 48 years?

.

(8) Anti Septics On Meat
[2005],[Kathy]

Now, since I've been getting that kind of need, what is the best thing to do for anybody that's done this already

They know about the antiseptics they use?

[Aajonus]

Well, you're eating enough fat with it to bind with those poisons, but you're wasting some of your fats by eating that antiseptic.

[Kathy]

I know, but I wanted to know, do I eat any more eggs, maybe 6 eggs are day.

[Aajonus]

You're already taking care of it with your diet?

It's just that you would have lost nutrients.

, so it's dispelled with the antiseptic.

Your poisons are already arrested.

[Kathy]

But I mean, this fish I bought today here, and there's a pack I bought at home.

What should I do with it.

[Aajonus]

You just eat your normal fat with it?

[Kathy]

How much fat.

[Aajonus]

Just what you're normally eating?

You can only eat so much food in a day.

Much of It's going to go out with the poisons, and not be used to stabilize and make you healthier, but it can prevent damage.

So, as much as you can eat is what you eat and you're eating, you've got a good weight.

So, I wouldn't say for you to eat anymore.

.

(9) Asians Don't Eat Ripe Fruit
[2005],[Aajonus]

The Asians know that, they don't get much meat

Most of the Asians, only about 5 to 10% of their diet is protein.

So, when they eat fruit, it has to be completely green, like a completely green mango, which is really tart and sour, but it gives them enzymes without giving them all the sugar.

So, they have to be very careful.

The younger generation is getting programmed with all this garbage information about health and they're eating all this ripe fruit and you there's more muggings, there's more illiteracy.

There's all kinds of problems with the younger generation that the older generation didn't have to suffer because they knew not to eat ripe fruit.

You rarely see an Asian over the age of 35 that eats any fresh ripe fruit.

They will always eat it green, but the kids now all the way up to 35 years old, are eating this overripe fruit and they're not happy people.

.

(10) Bacterial Infections, Stem Cells Inestead Of Bypass
[2005],[Attendee]

Couple of years ago, my dad started coming down with flu like symptoms, and he was stiff and couldn't walk, and he went to the hospital and the doctor said he had a bacterial infection in his heart, and I guess he almost died, and they cut open the sternum and deem like a, take it out and stuff and then it spread to his knee

They said it was endocarditis or something.

I don't know if you have any ideas.

.

.

[Aajonus]   Again, the bacteria is there to get rid of that decaying tissue.

So, he had to have that in the heart, and that knee for the bacteria to go to that area, to feed, to feast.

But the bacteria wasn't the problem, it was the toxicity causing the decaying tissue on which the bacteria fed.

[Attendee]   Okay.

So, now that he has like a pig heart, or part of a pig heart, and the metal stuff in the sternum, what can I do for him.

[Aajonus]   Well, I have partners in Bangkok, which owned the first cardiac stem cell therapy, and what they do is they extract the blood from the person?

They send it to Israel were a laboratory of scientists discovered this, how to separate stem cells that relate to the heart.

Then they breed those cells, they send them back to Bangkok, inject it in the heart area of the person and 85% of the patients out of the last two years in trials, 85% of them regrew- they had their own natural heart bypass.

The body would build a completely new artery to the heart, 85% of the cases.

It's gone so well that the government of Thailand cut the testing down one year.

So, now they can do it commercial.

And the good King's own cardiologists are part of the board of the company, and there are seven Nobel prize winners who have joined the company because of the incredible results.

So, if your father wants his own bypass from his own body where you don't have to worry about rejecting other people's cells or fetus cells or stem cells from the person's own body, get put in there.

And all the cases, the 15% that it didn't work for, or 16% that didn't work for, there was no ill symptoms.

They just didn't grow the heart valve.

That's an option.

[Kathy]   What does that cost.

[Aajonus]   About 60,000, which is about half the price of the bypass?

[Kathy]   60,000 American dollars.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

[Kathy]   You have to go there one for one treatment.

How many treatments does it take?

[Aajonus]   Only one?

You have to go to Bangkok, they take your blood, they send it to Israel.

They read it there takes 10 days, send it back to Bangkok and inject it in you, and you go.

They can take people who were wheelchairs, three months they're out playing tennis.

[Kathy]   You have to pay it in one full balance.

[Aajonus]   I don't know?

They're the ones who are on the primal diet.

The owners of it are the primal diet, and they want to build a primal center to get people to go to the primal center two weeks to four weeks before they have their blood extracted.

So, they think it will work 100%.

[Kathy]   Do you have their phone number.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, I do?

Do you have a question.

[Attendee #2]   I don't have mobility, and it's gotten a lot better as time goes on?

Is there anything I can eat to help with the mobility.

[Aajonus]   Well, a good diet with lots of raw meat, but if you wrap a piece of meat around there?

Every other night, wrap a piece of meat around the entire area from here all the way down to here, wrap it all the way around and it will help it quickly.

Putting fermented coconut oil will help break down the scar tissue here and scar tissue inside.

So, one night you can put on the coconut oil and the next meat.

.

(11) Berries & Coco Cream To Remove Mercury & Aluminum
[2005],[Attendee]

I've never been able to have a sense of smell since I can remember

Do you know anything about that.

[Aajonus]   That's usually very damaged olfactory glands?

Often it comes from vaccines, from the aluminum or mercury getting stored in that olfactory gland from a vaccine from an early age.

The only thing I've known to remove the mercury or aluminum is to eat berries.

If it's, mercury, you have to use dark berries, if it's aluminum, you have to use raspberries.

Combination of both of them with coconut cream and some honey, and maybe a little bit of butter and a little bit of dairy cream to help flush it out of the system.

Eating papaya helps bring back senses.

Let me also address it, just to inhaling a poison.

If you inhaled formaldehyde, for some reason, if you're exposed to formaldehyde, it could damage those sensory glands permanently until you're eating the right foods over a long period of time to get rid of the scar tissue and the poisons that are stuck there, but any kind of inhaled poison can do it too.

.

(12) Bringing Food On Plane
[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

I mean, either the carry on-

If it goes through your luggage department, the radiation is a hundred times more than it is for your carry on, so carry it through

It can go through that level of radiation one time only without damaging it.

[Attendee]   That's not the metal detector.

[Aajonus]   No, that's not the metal detector?

You walk through the metal detector.

[Kathy]   You walk through it with your bag on.

[Aajonus]   They won't let you do that?

It has to go through the scanner.

[Kathy]   Oh, the scanner is okay.

[Aajonus]   I'm saying there's no way they're going to let you do it?

Some people are able to talk security out of it, but not at LAX.

They're the biggest Nazi fascists people in the world.

So full of their power.

I go there with a doctor's letter that says my food is my medicine.

I take them from the website for Homeland security, showing that all you have to do is ask them to hand inspect it, if it's your medication.

My doctor's note says my food is my medication, but they will not let me.

[Kathy]   Whys that.

[Aajonus]   Cause they're Nazis?

[Attendees]   Laughs  They don't let anybody have a good reason.

[Attendee]   So the less worst is the scanner, right.

[Aajonus]   Your carry on?

It can go through there one time because the radiation is low level and won't stay long.

When you put it through your check-in luggage that is heavy, heavy radiation.

100x higher.

Cause they have to x-ray thick baggage, and if you've got, photographic material from movie Edison, and a company shipping stuff.

It's got to go through a lot of heavy stuff, even through metal.

.

(13) Brushing Teeth
[2005],[Aajonus]

From the brain, it will cause the teeth to abraise, and you'll bruise the dentine more, and then you'll have teeth decay

Again, decay doesn't come from bacteria, that bacteria results from the decaying of the gum cells from the dentine from the damage of the poisoned minerals, the free radicals that have damaged the live cell.

Dentine is a live cell, bones a live cell If it's damaged by a free radical metal, like mercury or aluminum, that cell is damaged.

Bacteria results to eat the decay.

Bacteria is not the problem.

The bacteria is a result of the disease, of the damage.

Just like you find a carcass out there, the vultures and crows come to eat up the decay.

They didn't call us the decay, they're a response of the decay.

That is very important to understand that we should not fear bacteria, parasites, and virus anymore.

We need to prevent ourselves from consuming, whether it's breathing or eating or drinking as many pollutants as possible refrain from eating pollutants.

Refrain from breathing and drinking pollutants that causes degenerative tissue, that is disease.

So, when you have those heavy metals coming into the sinuses, it takes, let's say you've got one molecule of mercury or one molecule of the aluminum, it takes 2000 fat- .

(14) Bycycling & Prostate Cancer
[2005],[Aajonus]

Anytime you would exercise and get circulation into an area, as long as you have good nutrients in your in your blood and, and intestines, it's going to aid any disease

[Attendee]

Is there any truth to that, she said about prostate cancer and riding bicycles.

[Aajonus]

You mean that it would harm?

If you've got a seat that puts pressure on that and blocks circulation to that, yes?

Yeah, but if you can get those seats that will rest on those two bones and you're not pressing up in the prostate area right here, then it's fine.

Cause when you've got that, horn coming through there, I had to cut my off and I lived off of a bicycle for nine years.

I would refuse to get into a car.

A horn.

You've got the seat that goes like this, okay.

You've got this penis thing, this horn, I cut it off?

So, I didn't have it riding up my crotch all that time.

Well, now they developed seats just have those two things.

.

(15) Chemicals On Meat
[2005],[Aajonus]

The extra pollution, all the more chemicals we have, you go into a restaurant, you go buy your meat

Do you know what the protocol in California is.

You wash an item, you rinse it, and then you have to dip it in an antiseptic, which is a poison?

So, every time you eat something from a store, a regular store, you're getting a chemical antibacterial agent in your food.

That's why a lot of people were complaining about their meat and fish tasting like soap, because that's exactly what it is, and nobody's stopping these health authorities from doing this, and you have to understand that every health official is a doctor.

So, they believe that bacteria, virus, and parasites are your problem.

But we've been living with parasites and bacteria for millions of years.

[Kathy]   Does that go for health foods, the fish that you buy there.

[Aajonus]   That's right?

If you want it cut, when I go in there to have something, I say, I want something out of the refrigerator.

I want you to hose that counter off.

I want you to hose the knife off, and I want you to cut it without any antiseptic.

Cause they have a thing they dip their knives in that has the antiseptic in it, and they dip it and they cut, they dip it and they cut.

[Kathy]   A lot of people didn't know about those things until you just brought it up now.

I mean I'm talking about Whole Foods is a health store.

[Aajonus]   It's Wild Oats, it's everywhere.

[Attendee]   Is that a law now.

[Aajonus]   It's a law?

It's not a true law.

It's a regulation of the state of California Health Department.

I just got some money, so I'm going to file suit within the next four months to stop it, and let me tell you, it's going to make a lot of waves.

There's going to be a lot of nasty things going on, but I'm going to shout it loud and clear.

Somebody gave me a $25,000 donation to be able to do it.

I don't know how far it's going to take it, but at least we can get it out there and get started on it because I'm going to try to get an injunction against it.

I'm also going to try to get an injunction against the federal government for the law that no commercial juice can be raw.

It has to be pasteurized or irradiated.

So, I'm going to try to get an injunction against that.

[Kathy]   So, in other words, you have to tell them before they cut it- shouldn't buy the Rocky chicken that's underneath that other chicken if it was cut with a certain knife.

[Aajonus]   Okay?

The boards that they cut on, they take a sponge, and they wash it down with something.

Then they don't rinse it with clean water.

[Kathy]   That water is chemical.

[Aajonus]   They have buckets there with that stuff in, and also, they have filters that puts the antiseptic right into their water?

It goes into that area.

So, you have to tell them you want that board washed with clean tap water that has no antibacterial in it, no detergents in it whatsoever.

No antiseptic.

[Kathy]   And the knife too.

[Aajonus]   And the knife too, tell them it has to be rinsed and no antiseptic on it?

[Kathy]   That's the main thing.

Okay.

[Aajonus]   I like getting my meat from James' place because they don't use any of that.

[Kathy]   It's just when you run out, you have to run to the store to get the fish.

.

(16) Coconut Oil & Where To Buy
[2005],[Aajonus]

That's the fermented coconut oil

You have to get the one that says fermented coconut oil.

Not from James, he only has one coconut oil.

He has coconut cream, that's refrigerated, but the coconut oil that looks like Crisco when it's cool.

That is fermented coconut oil from Thailand.

[Kathy]

That's good.

[Aajonus]

That's great, and the one now that they just changed their process in the last three weeks for me?

So, now we can buy that off the internet.

It's cheaper.

[Attendee]

What's the difference between fermented, and non fermented.

[Aajonus]

Well, they make it centrifugally spun, the molecules in that are much harder, and larger, so it's harder to digest?

So, when it's fermented, and it was only fermented for about 12 to something like 19 hours, that's all.

Just to get the oil to separate from the cream.

Cause there's still lectins in there that needs to separate from new oil.

So, that takes fermentation to do it a natural way that's more digestible, and utilizable.

The one with the larger molecule that's centrifugally spun, harder molecule, doesn't absorb into the skin, the skin can break can't down with its own enzymes very well.

It's a more difficult oil, but it's just as expensive to get the one that can be utilized better, which is the fermented.

.

(17) Cold Pressed Coconut Oil
[2005],[Aajonus]

It's not a fermented, completely cold pressed

In their process, they steam or boil the coconut before they press it.

I've gone to every one of them, and I said, I want it in writing from your producer, not from the wholesaler or the retailer I want it from the producer.

So, I go right to the people who make it, and I say, I want to know your process and you have to give it to me in writing, and there's only one company that did.

All the other companies' statements.

Well, we do heat it to 170 - 215 ° before we cold press it.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]   Laughs

I say, why do you call it unheated, and cooked.

"Well, during the process we don't", and I said, "that's deceiving the people"?

So, I put it out on the internet, everybody was false.

Now this company, the only thing that they were doing wrong, this one company was a fermented coconut oil.

They would heat it up a little higher temperature than I wanted.

So, they brought that down and they were also rinsing it with chlorinated water before they pressed and fermented it.

So, I got them to take the chlorine out of the water and use good well water.

So, now it's good stuff.

[Not good anymore],[Kathy]

How much is theirs.

[Aajonus]   I don't remember, but it's cheaper to fly from the Philippines than it is from Thailand?

It's a very long distance, very expensive, but I still like the taste of the one from Thailand better than Philippines.

I mean, this is very tasty stuff from James.

.

(18) Detox & High Meat
[2005],[Attendee]

I noticed in your second book you recommended not to take high meat during detoxification

Is that right.

[Aajonus]

if you're already detoxifying, I don't suggest it for some reaso?

I mean, you can do it.

I have people who do it, but Some people, it causes more vomiting, stuff like that.

So, I don't suggest it for that reason.

I didn't want people to freak out.

Yeah, I do it, and I know lots of people that do it, but I know some people that freaked out when they had it during a detox.

Caused massive diarrhea, and vomiting, which is not a bad thing, but for them it was enough to scare them off the diet.

Just completely stopped the diet, not just the high meat.

So, you know, I stayed away from that problem because even if it happens and only 5% of the people it's too much.

.

(19) Detoxing Throuhg Teeth, Teeth Pain, Pain Formula
(20) Diabetes Cured From Raw Milk
[2005]

Hippocrates fed all of anybody who had diabetes a raw milk diet, and they got rid of it in two weeks,

Diabetes rid of in two weeks on an all raw milk diet that was not refrigerated milk that was straight out of the cow, non-refrigerated milk.

So, if you do nowadays, it may take six weeks to get rid of diabetes.

Howell, and a lot of other doctors did it throughout the 1800s, and early 1900s, it's even done at Mayo clinic.

Well, when the pharmaceutical industries took over the universities and the medical schools, it all became about taking medication rather than curing and healing.

.

(21) Fermented Coconut
[2005],[Aajonus]

Coconuts are 80% fat, 15% protein and 5% sugars, but it's different fermented

That's fine fermented, overly ripe.

It will help just cleanse you.

[Attendee]

So, if you eat a lot of fat with fermented fruit that's not the same.

[Aajonus]

It will make more soaps for cleansing, so if you can handle an intense detoxification, that's fine?

Not for you.

[Attendee]

And if it still tastes too sour for you the pineapple, very rank.

Can you have honey with it.

[Aajonus]

Yes, you can have as much honey as you want, as long as you're eating enough meat?

.

(22) Food Colorings & Flavorings, Vegetale Oils Resings Etc
[2005],[Aajonus]

I always talk about something that I've done over the years, just to give you more understanding of what's happening in your body

When you ate syrups and a soda pops and all of that, all of those flavored oils that they gave you in those drinks, and syrups, jams and jellies where they increase the flavor or put flavoring in candy.

It was a resin.

It's a resin from vegetable oil.

That's what causes almost 98% of all the stones, whether the kidney stones, gallbladder stones, urinary tract stones, whatever develops it's from those food oils.

How you can break them down and get them out of the body is by mixing coconut cream with a little vinegar, lemon juice and pineapple, and you put those together and you might start passing sand, and if you had those little grains analyzed, you would find out which you were discarding.

I hadn't done it in a long time, so I started doing it a few months ago, and I was a big syrup eater with pancakes, and that's what it was.

The crystalized resins from the syrup that I ate so much of, and also one of the crystals that came out was from boysenberry syrup that I used to love with waffles.

[Attendee]   So, coconut cream, lemon, vinegar.

[Aajonus]   And you can put an egg in that, just if somebody is too thin, and doesn't have enough protein, you should put an egg in it too?

That will help eliminate some crystals in your system that block proper cellular functioning, whether it's in the gland or kidneys, and most often those do store around the kidneys, and the bladder.

That's why they dump so often into there, and if you had that formula, let's say once a month, once every three weeks, when you develop the stones, they won't be large ones, they'll be smaller.

If they get too large, it makes it difficult to pass urine and makes you feel like you always want to urinate, and then you have to force it to get the sand through.

It's a good time of the year.

This time of the year in between January and in June is a good time to detoxify the sand, and stones from the resins.

.

(23) Hand Pain = Antibiotic Poisons, Penicillin, Moldy Berries
[2005],[Attendee]

I'd like to talk about my left hand here a little bit

For a year or so, I had pain from here down to my hand, and it was up and down.

Sometimes missing, sometimes serious, and I asked you about it about a month ago, and you told me about hot water bottles.

So, I started using hot water bottles.

Probably not very smart, but I went to sleep with my hand on a hot water bottle, and it's pretty much just concentrated in the hand.

But it feels like the sensation it's like crushed sometimes, now it's advancing and it stings or feels crushed, and then for a few days it wont hurt, and then it will come back real serious.

I thought it was a bruise, so I held onto some steak for awhile, and that would seem to calm down, but if I over did it, it wouldn't do anything about it.

I've been known to detox one way or another.

I'm not shocked by this particularly, but I would like it to not hurt.

[Aajonus]

Well, mainly when you have that kind of a pain, it's antibiotic poisons, which stores in immune antibodies, so living in the joints, and they throw off a very nasty toxic.

If they're allowed to get active again, and they often do.

[unclear] in my thumbnail, and the whole thumb, and I had the pus analyzed, and it came up from penicillin.

The byproducts of the penicillin toxicity, and that caused severe pain for about 18 months off and on in that thumb.

I've had lots of penicillin, lots of antibiotics in my childhood, and I used to get joint pains.

I ended up with bone cancer as a product of that, as part of a product of that thing.

When I had the radiation therapy that sealed it.

The two compounds together caused the bone cancer.

Blood and bone cancer.

So, getting rid of that is not easy.

Eating moldy berries.

Whole moldy berries, let's say you ate three of them a day, every other day for about six weeks, you could help destroy those molds.

Always eat it with an egg because when those toxins start being released, it can cause soreness and bruising.

Like you're having the feeling here, like everything is bruised and sore.

You don't have enough of particular kinds of fat to bind with those particular byproducts.

.

(24) Hereditary Disease
(25) Home Renovation, Milk Paint
[2005],[Attendee]

The home renovation, painting interiors

What products to use.

[Aajonus]   Well, when I've done that, I used to be a painter?

So, when I would paint, I would always wear big gas masks that they used in wars.

You know, I got these Israeli gas masks, and these two HEPA filters on it, plus charcoal cartridges, and I painted that way.

And then I went away for five days and left three heaters in each room to cook it.

With very little cracks in the window, so just enough air could pass out to where it wouldn't catch the house on fire, but it baked everything in.

Otherwise, it can outgas for a year.

If it's oil paint, it'll outgas for five years.

[Attendee]   So, that will solve your problems.

[Aajonus]   Well, there's milk paint made out of casein from milk?

You have to mix it yourself, and it's a lot less toxic, but again, you still need to bake it.

[Attendee]   I can find somebody else to do my painting.

[Aajonus]   And you could do what I used to do when I used to decorate and do painting.

I would go to the colleges, and get art students, and I would teach them how to model and do designs and walls and everything pay them a very little fee, but they got credit for doing that kind of work cause it was like a work credit thing they got.

So I could pay them $7 - $8 an hour, and they'd be doing $50 an hour - $100 an hour work because that's what I charge.

Sometimes I charge $200 an hour, depends upon the client.

.

(26) How We Get Disease & Contagions
[2005],[Attendee]

How do you get sick

[Aajonus]   You get sick from poisons in the body?

Her problem is she wants to know about disease, how we get disease, and about contagions.

The new book, the revision of the first book has all that explanation in detail that I wasn't allowed to give the first publication of it.

I explained exactly what virus are, I explained exactly what causes disease.

How the whole logic of contagion is misconstrued for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry.

And now of course, the medical industry, because they make fortunes on it.

When you look at any of the medical manuals, they're written by Merck and Bayer.

And they want you to live with your disease and take medication.

Every disease they want to look at like diabetes.

So, you take it medicine every day to live with your disease, and instead of cure it, yet the father of medicine Hippocrates.

.

.

.

(27) Human Growth Hormone
[2005],[Attendee]

In anti-aging, they talk about HGH

Basically, as you get older, it's diminishes.

[Aajonus]   HGH is made by the human body only.

The chemical they sell, it's not human growth hormone.

It's a chemical process that mimics growth hormone.

It's chemically made in a laboratory.

Sometimes we're taking it from like a wheat grass.

They will take the growth hormone from the wheat grass and call it human growth hormone after they chemically alter it.

But it's still a chemical that has nothing to do with human growth hormone.

The only way you can get your own growth hormone is to continue is to eat raw meat.

I'm doing pretty well for getting on 60 for somebody who is supposed to be dead at 21.

.

(28) Humidifier
[2005],[Attendee]

Would a humidifier relieve you temporarily

[Aajonus]

A humidifier is good, as long as you're using good water?

Don't use tap water.

.

(29) Instinctive Diet Fruit
[2005],[Aajonus]

And she went on the diet after she investigated, and researched it, but then she was on the diet for two years, doing very, very well

She's a very ultra skinny person.

She got on some weight, and then she believed that that, instincto was more natural, and I said, but you're not in a natural environment.

It's too toxic to be in a natural instinctive diet, and also your instincts aren't true.

And she died a year after being on that diet.

She got so skinny.

She wasted away, and got fatigued and died.

Instincto is everything has to smell good for them to eat it.

If it doesn't smell good, they won't eat it.

So, 60% of their diet is fruit.

Tears the body to pieces.

[Attendee]

What about fruitarians.

[Aajonus]

Their teeth are rotting away, their bones are disappearing?

There are very few of them who do well beyond seven years.

[Kathy],[Aajonus]

They're so skinny,

And they're very overly emotional and they don't think very clearly.

.

(30) Irregular Heartbeat
[2005],[Attendee]

I have atrial fibrillation

[Kathy]   What's that.

[Aajonus]   Irregular heartbeat?

[Attendee]   It's when the atrium beats faster, it flutters.

[Aajonus]   And that's good.

Your heart's dancing.

[Attendee]   It's been dancing steady for two years, irregular.

[Aajonus]   My father, he was diagnosed with it when he was 62 years old, he had a smart doctor and he said, "Stop counting".

[Kathy]   You mean it's called, "A Regular Heartbeat".

[Aajonus]   Irregular heartbeat, it beats very rapidly, sometimes you're in arrhythmia happens where it beats rapidly, and then it'll beat a bit, miss a beat and go rapidly?

Again, it was just irregular heartbeat, but usually rapid heartbeat is a part of it.

[Attendee]   Rapid isn't part of mine.

[Aajonus]   Yours is always rapid, you have no cessation.

[Attendee]   No, it's not rapid?

It's irregular.

It's caused by the atrial fibrillation.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, but that's not a bad thing.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   Well, according to the cardiologist-

The cardiologist is trying to make his money.

[Attendee]   Well, no.

I don't do any drugs.

I don't go to cardiologists, but when I did they wanted to put me on coumadin.

[Aajonus]   That's right, they want to put you on drugs.

[Attendee]   I said, no, I'm not going to do rat poison.

What they did instead- I have a holistic doctor, and it's fish oil, and some things so the blood doesn't coagulate.

[Aajonus]   Coagulation is not a fibrillation problem.

[Attendee #2]   What about C0Q10.

[Attendee]   Yeah, that's another?

[Aajonus]   Again, those are all chemicals.

Those are manmade chemicals.

They're not made by the body.

Your body makes your own C0Q10, but they don't sell what the body makes.

They do in the chemistry lab.

It's an entirely different substance.

It has no vitamins, no enzymes attached to it.

[Attendee]   So, the theory is that we have this condition.

We're more likely to get a stroke.

[Aajonus]   That is absolute fiction.

There's no evidence to prove that.

That's a hypothesis without any basis of proof, and if you read "The Cholesterol Myth", you'll read a lot of the fallacies about heart conditions that are attributed to that.

The fish oil is good idea because the muscles need fat.

However, you cannot get a non-purified fish oil that isn't purified with a chemical solvent, and the FDA requires it to get it into this country.

So, even if it's from Norway, it is all purified, chemically purified.

It is a toxic substance.

[Attendee]   So, what oils would be the same as fish oil.

[Aajonus]   Butter, and fish, eating butter and fish together is great?

My father is now 89 this year, and he's at that atrial fibrillation now for 27 years.

No problems.

Never had a surgery.

.

(31) Kidney Function, Urine Vs Blood
[2005],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]   I do, it's about kidneys?

My mother just got diagnosed that her left kidney is completely not working, and her right kidney is 30% working.

Is there anything I can do to get it working.

[Aajonus]   That formula right there helps get the crystals- the resins out of the kidney that stops them from functioning, unless she's got some other poison in there?

What was her diet like.

The sad diet?

[Attendee]   Yeah?

[Aajonus]   She probably got a lot of poison, so who knows what's in there.

That could be a start?

As long as she has one kidney function, that's good.

Yeah.

I would suggest that drink then.

[Attendee #2]   What about eating kidney.

[Aajonus]   For most people who have kidney problems, the high ammonia causes them to get jaundice?

You can try it.

Doesn't always work.

Once they've been on the diet for about a year, year and a half, then they can eat the kidney then.

[Kathy]   So, you have ammonia, let's say it goes into the muscle meat or something.

It's like a cleanser.

Isn't it.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

[Kathy]   People have trouble to even taste it, it's so strong.

[Aajonus]   I know.

That's why people have trouble drinking urine.

Cause the only difference between blood, and urine is that there's ammonia, and very few red blood cells.

Otherwise, the contents of the urine is identical to the blood.

.

(32) Mercury & Aluminum & Dry Mouth - Fat,Honey,Butter
[2005],[Aajonus]

Well, the aluminum, it takes 2000 fat cells or about 1000 white blood cells to harness, and address that

How many do you think can surround one molecule.

Not much?

So, it all dries out.

All the fats in here are very minimal, you can keep fats everywhere in your body, but it isn't easy to keep that in the face.

There are some people that can, but they get up to 250, 300 pounds before they get a lot of excess weight in the face.

You cannot have that much fat in your face to deal with that much poisons.

So, you're going to have dryness, you're going to have dry mouth for 40 years, dry mouth is not dehydration.

That's the minerals coming out and using all the fats in your face, and surrounding area.

That leaves the mouth dry.

That's why I say honey, and butter in your mouth, let that stay in there, let the fat reabsorb, and you'll say, oh gosh, I didn't drink any water, and I don't have dry mouth, and I don't feel dehydrated.

It's got nothing to do with dehydration.

It's delipidization in here.

That's a very bad thing because you got the greatest amount of the most toxic poisons in your brain, and you've got the least amount of fat in your brain.

That's why there's so many stupid youth.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]   Laughs

Voted for bush Laughs.

[Kathy]   If anyone wants to order brain from the buffalo, just let me know.

[Aajonus]   I just ate rotten buffalo brain.

Let it go really ripe, didn't refrigerate it and let it get really nasty.

[Attendee #2]   Swallowed it.

[Aajonus]   Blended it with milk, and honey?

[Attendee #3]   But its not cheap.

[Aajonus]   Oh, it's expensive.

It's about $35 for a half a brain.

.

(33) Naps Are Good
[2005],[Aajonus]

Everybody should do that

That's the normal cycle of every animal on this planet, and insects.

They all midday take a nap.

That's why Mexico makes it a law.

Siesta is a law, not anymore in the big companies, because now America has gone down infiltrated the commercial division, but all your little villages, it was a law to take a siesta Absolutely take a nap.

Even John F.

Kennedy did.

There's an hour a day.

[Attendee]

Does Bush.

[Aajonus]

I don't know?

I rather doubt it.

Speeches are too good.

.

(34) No Dairy&Meat, What To Eat, No Fried Food
[2005],[Attendee]

What would be the best diet for someone won't eat raw meat, and can't get raw dairy, what should they eat dying

[Aajonus]   Die?

Eat lots of eggs, right.

[Attendee]   Raw eggs?

In terms of the other foods, which should they stay away from, and which should they eat?

[Aajonus]   It depends upon the individual?

[Attendee]   So, there's really no food other than eggs, there's no really better diet if you're not going to eat raw food.

[Aajonus]   Yeah?

Well, stay away from fried food.

That's the worst food in the world.

Any fried food, stir fry, doesn't matter.

.

(35) Nuts & Seeds - Phytic Acid
[2005],[Attendee]

One time you said you talking about nuts

They have enzyme inhibitors.

[Aajonus]

Phytic acid, all nuts and seeds.

[Attendee]

Okay, that was my question.

Seeds have that too.

[Aajonus]

All nuts, and seeds have phytic acid?

[Attendee]

So, if you eat an apple and ate the seed, is it too little to make it a problem.

[Aajonus]

It's not a really a problem with a few apple seeds, and also the phytic acid becomes more active once the seed is dried?

So, if you're eating a fresh apple seed, that doesn't have as much of a reaction.

[Attendee]

If you did want to eat some seeds, if you just combined it with a similar stuff that you use in the nut formula, that will neutralize the phytic acid, but I've done experiments where you eat the foods with the nuts.

Doesn't work for a lot of people, you have to blend it in.

You have to blend the nuts until they were a powder, and then add the ingredients and blend it all together for most people.

So, if you eat the nuts with some eggs, and some honey and some butter and you get gas, you start not digesting very well, and stuff starts slowing down, you got a phytic problem and you have to make the nut formula or seed formula, whatever you're doing.

It has to be blended together, and you just eating them together doesn't work for you.

[Kathy]

Now, what should I do.

[Aajonus]

Let me finish?

Did you get everything answered with that.

[Attendee]

Yeah, but if let's say you ate some seeds, and you just ate it separately, but there's no gas?

[Aajonus]

No problem, then you can handle it that way.

[Attendee #2]

But originally you said it was an enzyme inhibitor.

[Aajonus]

Enzyme inhibitors?

The phytic acid is an enzyme inhibitor.

[Attendee #3]

That makes the meat not as good.

[Aajonus]

It prevents you from digesting protein, utilizing protein for 24 to 36 hours?

Not only the protein in the nuts or seeds, but any protein from the eggs or meat that you eat.

It interferes with everything.

Not unless you're having the nut formula.

I say it's very important to have a once a week to handle the neurological byproduct poisons that you have in your body.

Every time you've gone through a traumatic experience or anxiety, you manufacturer hormones, psychological hormones.

They are byproducts of toxins, just like any other hormone in the body, stores just like any other hormone in the body.

When they are released into the blood and neurological system, the same emotional experience that you went through during that trauma or anxiety is relooked, it's remembered If you want to know the scientific basis for that, get on the internet.

Look under L Nora van Winkle's, "The Biology of Emotions".

There's a very long, profound technical with all the chemistry.

Elnora E L O R N A, Van Winkle, V A N - W I N K L E.

The Biology of Emotions.

There's a layman paper, and there's a very technical page.

She was a woman who spent 47 years cataloging every chemical in the brain, and nervous system at Columbia University, New York City.

That was her entire life, and when she retired, she had addressed every chemical in the brain and nervous.

She was the one that by some of my research that I found from analyzing vomit, blood, and chemistry secretion, I found neurological hormonal sites that were addressed with psychology, and she addressed it and she went on the diet.

.

(36) Oils
[2005],[Aajonus]

Very little, like I said, in the book, you have maybe two ounces of olive oil or flax oil or coconut oil, fermented coconut oil, you know, maybe six ounces a week, seven ounces at the most

If you're a big guy, you can have seven or eight ounces a week, but with only three meat meals.

Let's say you want a detoxification formula, let's say for cancer, you might put coconut oil, and some pineapple with some lemon juice, but that's to get the tumor to start dissolving.

After it's already dissolved, you don't want that kind of a thing except to get the byproducts.

So, you don't want that every day once you get to the tumors and start dissolving.

.

(37) Oils, Viruses&Bacteria&Parasites Breaking Down Toxicity
[2005],[Aajonus]

Anytime you have a concentrated oil, a product of something where the concentrated fats are in a liquid form

Coconut will get a hard at a very high temperature of 70°.

Coconut oil will still solidify like Crisco oil, but most of your oils stay pretty liquid.

As long as they're not refrigerated, drop below 60 degrees, 55 degrees.

Those oils are mainly solvent active in the body.

The body will make soaps with them.

They don't stabilize the body.

They don't increase mobility.

They don't help lubricate.

They don't calm the system.

They're there to help dissolve poisons in the system like we use the degreasers.

The body can make a lot of degreasers, and a lot of compounds to dissolve the toxicity that we can't use the bacteria parasites to do it.

We have to use virus because the tissue is too contaminated.

The poisons in the cells are so poisonous if the bacteria, parasites eat those cells, it kills them.

So, the only thing left is virus.

solvents; soaps to cleanse and break down those by solvent process.

And if you want to get an idea of the difference in the viability of using the different substances, let's say you had a dog, and you had all restaurant, and you had all of this waste that you weren't allowed to throw in the garbage can, you need an animal to eat it.

So, you've got a big dog that eats a hundred times in a day, and it ends up having a turd 1.

5 pounds the next day.

That's what parasites, and bacteria do.

They consume massive amounts of their weight in a 24-hour period and leave very little waste product.

When your body uses a virus or any other kind of a solvent, what happens when you take a solvent, you dilute it, you clean the area, you have a whole bucket of waste that will spread throughout the entire body environment.

That's why cerebral meningitis is bad and, and spinal meningitis is bad because it's viral.

The medical profession doesn't freak out as much if it's bacterial because you don't have all that swelling in the brain and nervous system with bacterial infection, a detoxification of the nervous system, and brain as you do with a virus, it spreads all this fluid, contaminated fluid.

Causes more pain, more likelihood of paralysis.

So, eating oils helps the body cleans poisons that cannot be degenerated by bacteria, and parasites.

When I had the chemotherapy and radiation.

I never got a bacteria.

I never got bacterial infection or a parasitical infection since those days up until this last year.

Got a parasite for the first time, I celebrated.

All of a sudden, all of that pyloroplasty that they did on me when I was 20 years old, they took the duodenum, stretched it to 3x its size.

What happens when you take tissue, and you stretch it and rip it like that 40% scar tissue within the first year, 80% scar tissue within five years from that.

So, 80% of my duodenum was scar tissue.

What the hell was the point of stretching the duodenum.

It's pretty absurd, but that's what they did?

When I got the parasite.

All of a sudden, I started detoxing duodenum, it's working, and it hadn't worked since I was 20 years old, and I just started my 59 years today.

Finally working after all this time because I was able to get a parasite to help me.

[Kathy]   So, you're able to digest your food now better.

[Aajonus]   I'm able to digest?

[Kathy]   Do you have hydrochloric acid, it's going now.

[Aajonus]   No, I didn't say that?

The duodenum.

The hydrochloric acids in the stomach.

The bile and a lot of other enzymes dump into the stomach, and taking an enzyme is transferring it to the pancreas.

Pancreas restructures the enzyme for our abilities and natures, then dumps it back into the duodenum, and other parts of the intestine.

So, that's what came back.

.

(38) Organic Vs Non Organic Cucumber & Peeling Cucumbers Erections
[2005],[Aajonus]

If it's organic, I put the whole cucumber, the peel and all, if it's not waxed

It can be called organic, and they still wax it, FDA has allowed them to do that.

So, I can tell, you take a cucumber, take a non-cerated, like paring knife.

You scrape it gently.

If wax comes off of it, and you put it in your fingers, it dissolves and goes away.

That's its natural wax.

Same as an apple.

If you, if that gets waxy and stays.

That's plastic.

That's paraffin wax.

That's an artificial wax.

If a man can't get hard very easily, do not use the peel, peel it.

If you're having problems with erections, if you have that formula without the pineapple in it, and let's say three to three cups of cucumber, it'll help erection.

Keep erections, unless you keep the peel for some reason, there's an enzyme in it that causes it not to get hardness to the penis.

So, don't use the peel if you want to be hard, if you're going to do that.

Just peel the cucumber and use that.

Women don't have to worry about that.

.

(39) Pinworms, Tapeworms
[2005],[Kathy]

All those that you can find in fish

[Aajonus]   Pinworms.

I've eaten thousands of them and didn't get them.

[Kathy]   Would it help anybody to eat it.

[Aajonus]   Absolutely?

[Kathy]   If anybody's interested, I can get a monkfish liver.

If they want to get a pinworm.

[Aajonus]   But I ate a pinworm infested pound of salmon.

It was undulating, must've been at least 10 million eggs in there.

I ate it, and I didn't one pinworm.

Cause all the chemo and radiation poisoning.

So, I wasn't able to breed one however, in other sick animals that I fed the parasites.

I could not get them to breed a parasite from eating the meat.

So, it's rather a myth.

The way the Joel Weinstock did it was he put the whip worm eggs in Gatorade, which is highly alkalinize.

So, they drank the eggs from the whip worm, and it went into their intestines, and when it went through their stomach, the hydrochloric acid was neutralized by the Gatorade.

So, the eggs are able to survive that tract, so they were able to breed in the intestine.

I never gave an animal Gatorade with these whip worms because that's not natural.

So, you can't naturally get it.

It has to be an element again, of our industrial society that can allow you to pass into the stomach and intestines without being dissolved by the hydrochloric acid.

(40) Protein Deficiency Causing Poor Sleep 7Depression
[2005],[Aajonus]

Protein, raw protein

Most people can't sleep because they're protein deficient.

Most people get depressed because they're protein deficient, although that I said in the first book, I said it was majorly a sugar problem.

So, I said have lots of honey, eggs, together to go to sleep.

But that would mainly cause such a high sugar level that it just knocked people out.

You know, like you have a candy, and you go on a high, and an hour or two later you crash.

So, that's basically what I would force people into.

It was a quick way to do it.

Most people, if you say it's a protein deficiency, they need lots of raw eggs, and raw meat, they don't do it.

But that is the major reason.

It's the protein.

If you aren't able to digest, and utilize the protein that you were eating before, it would keep you from sleeping properly.

Now that you're eating a meat and almost everybody can digest, 99% of the people I've seen can digest raw meat, period.

9%.

[Attendee]   Protein, does that also mean fish.

[Aajonus]   Any kind of meat, yes?

There are some people where there's a sleep center in the brain that gets damaged from vaccines, some other poisoning.

Then it doesn't have anything to do with protein deficiency.

They just can't sleep.

I know one fellow, he was the designer and developer of Piper Aircraft, I was a good friend of the Piper family.

This man got really tired one time, and a propeller backed up, and cut his head off, top of his head, hit the sleep center.

He hasn't slept in 36 years.

He has no trouble.

He doesn't get fatigued or doesn't get tired.

He goes all day long and he's not bad, real effected?

He rests, but he never sleeps  For him, it's fine.

It's fine for him.

Most people it isn't.

Most people would turn out to be George Bush and go bomb a country.

You can tell I like George Bush.

.

(41) Raw Cream To Calm The Nerves
[2005],[Aajonus]

Well, let's say you've got a nerve irritant, then it can be a matter of eating raw cream

Then you needed both, the protein and the cream.

The raw cream is the best to soothe the nervous system.

If you find yourself uptight and rigid.

You go drink a cup of raw cream, and you'll be relaxed within a few hours.

Growing pains.

That's a protein deficiency, and a fat deficiency?

He's got to eat a lubrication formula with it.

The lubrication formula in the recipe book.

You're going to get that when we go out.

Just have them have that during the eating of the meat, not just after.

.

(42) Ripe Vs Green Pineapple, Killer Monkeys
[Attendee]

Is there a difference between ripe pineapple, and green pineapple

[Aajonus]

He asked if there's a difference between ripe pineapple, and green pineapple?

Yes.

Pineapple will cause more over emotionality when it's ripe than any other fruit besides banana.

Banana when it's brown ripe, and pineapple, when it's yellow ripe, almost fermented.

It will cross more over emotionality than any other food.

Also fermented figs will do that, but most people don't eat fermented figs, but a lot of people eat overripe pineapple, and overripe bananas.

To give you an idea of what happens in the body, you take a look at the apes, they will only eat green bananas, and they eat the rind with it.

These eat the peel, everything on it.

I can't do it.

It's too astringent, and too alimony tasting.

They're used to it; they have more salivary juices.

The monkeys when they eat bananas, they eat them ripe, and you notice that you get a chimpanzee or any kind of a squirrel monkey.

The first thing in the morning they're really calm.

You give them a ripe banana and they'll just be erratic and screaming most of the day.

The killer monkeys, before they go on a kill binge, they will go on a fruit binge They eat all these overripe fermented guavas and figs, and bananas for 24 hours before they go on a killing spree and then they'll go out and kill all kinds of other monkeys and other animals.

Anything in their path, they'll slaughter them for 24 hours.

As long as that sugar is eating on their brain, nervous system.

Cause the sugars actually eat into the myelin to get the fats because the sugars are looking for fats to interact with.

If it can't find it, it goes into the nervous system, and that's what happens.

So, the green pineapple is high in enzymes and not high in sugar.

When any fruit is ripe, you're going to have a high amount of sugar, and you're going to have irritation to the nervous system if you're not fat, and don't have a lot of fat in your blood, and you're going to have over emotionality.

[Attendee]

Eat it green.

[Aajonus]

Eat it green?

Get it as hard as you can get it, as green as you can get it, and as white inside as you can get it.

All fruit.

.

(43) Smallpox
[2005],[Attendee]

Yes

When, when the friendly Europeans came over here, and took the land away from the Indians, they were killing them with bullets and whatever they had.

[Aajonus]   Formaldehyde.

[Attendee]   They found that they killed more Indians with the white man's diseases', and today the Europeans all get chickenpox when they're in kindergarten.

Was there some relationship.

[Aajonus]   No, that was a myth that was propagated?

Just like in Brazil, the British government, and this was documented.

I forgot the fellow's name.

He wrote a play called savages, and this was in Brazil.

They would pay these men to go out, and slaughter, and poison the natives, and say it was smallpox because anytime you put formaldehyde or some kind of poison that's non-detectable in their water system, they'll get either a chicken pox or a smallpox type symptom.

And then they just say, "Oh these people died of smallpox", but it was poisoning.

They've been doing that ever since Caesar was around.

Poisoning their enemies.

[Attendee]   How did they catch chickenpox kindergarten.

Everybody seems to catch it in the classroom?

[Aajonus]   Well, everybody all over the world gets chicken pox, that's a detoxification is nervous system at a young age.

[Attendee]   But it's really not contagious thing.

[Aajonus]   Everybody detoxes at a certain time?

It's like when the bears come out of hibernation, do you say they're contagious.

Because they come out of hibernation in the United States, and then a few degrees north in Canada, then they start waking up and then up higher in Canada, and Alaska, they all wake up?

So, is that contagious.

[Attendee]   Sounded like it?

[Aajonus]   Sounds like it, but that's the same thing with the Smallpox, and all that.

The body, during a certain climate temperature change, and humidity will detox certain tissue, and it's common among a lot of people at the same time.

Just like teenagers with acne.

You don't call that contagious, but boy, let me tell you, they'll probably call it contagious.

Some scientists that have been paid by the pharmaceutical industry.

I'll bet you in the next five years comes up with a virus that he says is contagious among teenagers with acne, and we've got a medication for it.

That should happen.

.

(44) Sprouting & Phytic Acid
[2005],[Aajonus]

There are three enzymes that react just like the phytic acid

So, even if you sprout it, you still got enzyme inhibitors in it.

Not only that in the sprout you have three, instead of one.

When a seed starts sprouting, it's then a vegetable, we don't handle vegetation.

We don't break cellulose down properly.

We don't have that kind of a digestive tract.

That's why I say stay away from whole vegetables, unless you've got a bowel condition or a small intestine condition that's too over acidic, and for a while you need whole vegetables in a salad, but normally it's not.

.

(45) Trichinosis
(46) Trouble Sleeping & Brain Detox
[2005],[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]   Yes?

I have trouble sleeping because my nose gets clogged up.

[Aajonus]   You need to cut down on cream, increase your butter, and sleep at an angle.

Eat more butter like the lubrication formula, and sleep at an angle.

So, your head is high.

You have to understand that when your brain dumps, it dumps most of the poisons out your gums, tongue, and sinus cavity.

Your brain and nervous system hold the most metals of anywhere in the body.

That's why Alzheimer's is a problem.

Because the body uses metallic minerals in the brain, and nervous system to transmit light, which is information for the nervous system.

So, anytime you eat anything, and it has any kind of metallic mineral in it, which all foods do, the cooking causes it to be free radical.

So, you have your greatest concentration of free radicals in the brain, and nervous system.

So, when that dumps, the brain has- usually the tonsils take care of it.

The sinuses, and the gums take care of most of the free radicals.

That's why so much dental decay, the heavy metals come out.

They surrounded the dentine, starts ripping the neurons out of your cells, i complicates the molecular structure, the structure of the teeth, and then you have degeneration.

So, keeping the mouth rinsed is important when you're dumping those metals out of your teeth.

Brushing your teeth isn't the greatest idea.

A water pick is the best thing to use to help rebuild those minerals.

Because if you're brushing mercury that's dumping from the brain, it will cause the teeth to abraise, and you'll bruise the dentine more, and you'll have teeth decay.

.

(47) Urine In Meat, Grain Fed Meat
[2005],[Kathy]

You bite it and eat it

Like James, the beef, he doesn't have that urine taste.

You know, like the muscle meat won't have that urine taste.

[Aajonus]   I can always taste.

It taste it in every meat I eat.

I'm very sensitive now, I can taste it in everything.

Grain fed animals don't have as high because they have more starch to bind with the ammonia.

When the animals killed, urine rushes back all through the bloodstream.

It gets into everywhere, and all the meat.

That's why it has a slight ammonia taste that I can detect on any meat except animals that are fed heavy grain.

They have a lot of starch to bind with that ammonia, and it blocks the taste.

[Attendee]   Is grain fed animals better than grass fed.

[Aajonus]   No, but I like some grain fed?

Now, when you see a cow out in the field, if he's in a field where the grass grows naturally, he won't eat the fresh seeds off of the plant.

He'll eat the green leaves around that doesn't carry the seed, but then you see him go down, and pick off the dried seed right off the top of the dirt.

He picks, and eats dried seed, that is normal.

They're grain eating animals, as long as it's dried grain.

So, I think that all animals should be slightly grain fed.

When they're fed hay, they don't get any- it's always cut.

They cut the alfalfa before it goes to the seed or after they cultivated the seed, so they can plant seed for next year.

The alfalfa is still without seed.

So, they're feeding these animals, grass fed animals that don't get any grain, and that's one of their natural products.

So, I don't agree with this all-grass fed.

.

(48) Vege Juice, How Much, When
[2005],[Aajonus]

You need to resupply minerals, and enzymes

That's were you get your supplement.

In the first book I said you need a minimum 2 cups a day.

Usually before a meat meal is the best time because you get highly acidic afterwards.

If you drink the vegetable juice after the meat.

Sometimes it interferes with digestion cause it will rush in quicker, and alkalinize some of the digestive acids You won't digest your meat as well.

So, that's why I always suggested the vegetable juice an hour before the meat meal.

That's the best way to do it.

I only drank one cup of vegetable juice a day.

If I had any more than that.

I started getting sleepy and tired.

It's too much now, but for many years I had to have 2 - 3, or 4 a day.

That is just dependent.

[Attendee]

How do you tell how much you need.

[Aajonus]

Let's say you're feeling a little acid, a little bit irritable, a little anxious?

You need more vegetables juice, unless you're eating a lot of fruit, then you need to cut down on the fruit.

.

(49) Virus & Parasites
[2005],[Aajonus]

Virus being contagious virus

Virus is not alive.

It's a protein body.

It's a crystalline protein structure that is not alive.

They say that self-replicates itself once it gets inside of the cell, that is a myth.

If something is not alive, it can't self-replicate.

It is an impossibility.

That's why if they take a Petri dish that can breed cells with cells, and they can grow in it, and they spike it with virus.

They do not multiply.

Whatever is the amount that you inject into that petri dish is all that's there.

As soon as they put cells in there, then the viruses get inside the cell.

Why is that.

Because the cells make it to decompose certain kinds of toxic tissue within the structure?

Let's say you have a bad liver, and your body decides to make a solvent of its own to clean the liver, which is hepatitis.

Your body makes hepatitis, there was about 8 varieties of hepatitis, and they say that there's mainly 3, and it's broken down in the sub within those 3.

But there's 8 varieties of a virus that is hepatitis oriented, and they can go in and clean out your liver.

Now, the way the medical profession gets you confused is they say, that is what will kill you.

That is the cure for the disease.

The disease is a degenerative liver.

The only way a liver can become degenerative is if you have poisons collect in it.

And when you eat cooked foods, as I explained in the recipe book, I named 33 compounds just from cooking foods that are toxins, that store in the body.

And if they collect over a lifetime, they create serious diseases.

If the placenta hasn't filtered out the toxins from the mother, a baby will be born with diseases.

Take, for example, I had a girl who was 28 years who came to me with breast cancer, hip cancer and kidney cancer, which was attached to the adrenal gland.

Her breasts hung down to here.

So, she always to go around like this, every time you saw her, she was always hiding that right breast.

28 years old, only able to work six hours a week.

That's how fatigued she was, and this started at 14 years old.

The doctor said all her tests were perfect.

She was in perfect health.

She was as skinny as a rail, very unhealthy, very unhappy.

Everything made her unhappy.

Her eyes were black.

Her mother had blue eyes.

Her father had green eyes, two sisters, the oldest sister had green eyes, the younger had blue.

Why did she have black eyes.

So, she went on the diet, five years after she was on the diet, she was able to work 40 hours a week, just normal?

Now seven years later, she works on a farm 14 - 16 hours a day.

Goes surfing, does all kinds of things, changed her life.

Her eyes went from black to blue and orange and they'll be blue.

Just like mine became blue from dark brown as I got healthier.

It took me 32 years, but I only have one faint brown spot left, in the next probably five years, they will be gone, and that's in my prostate.

Um, don't have any problems with my prostate, but that is an area in my eyes that shows the toxicity is still stored.

So, back to the point, the toxicity from whatever you eat, breathe and drink stores in your body, that creates degeneration in the cells.

Virus, bacteria, and parasites are there to eat up the degenerative tissue.

But they say, well, if you have a virus that enters the cell or the cell manufacturers a virus, it has an RNA in it that supplants itself within the DNA.

And then it will form more virus.

I said, that's the point.

But the RNA that the cell puts in that virus is to address only certain tissue.

That's like saying, okay, you're a virus that will be for the certain type of degenerative liver tissue.

So, this will be just a very refined hepatitis virus that will help break down those parts of the liver cells that are damaged and get rid of them.

Then if you're eating properly, you'll be able to rebuild, but most people don't eat properly, and constantly ingest the poisons.

So, that's how disease develops.

Just remember that bacteria, parasites, and virus are not your enemies.

Those are the cures for the disease.

The disease is the poisoning.

The reason people are getting so many more diseases, and 1/3 women gets cancer, 1/2 men gets cancer nowadays.

So, you gotta understand, why is that.

It's because all of the?
