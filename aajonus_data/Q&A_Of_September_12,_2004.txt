90% of Alfalfa is Sprayed

[2004] [Attendee] And now in Santa Fe all I can get is raw goat milk and they feed it grain. [Aajonus] Cows, deer; they all eat lots of grain. They eat grain all the time. Grain fed animals are fine. [Attendee] I thought organic pastures fed them grass? [Aajonus] No, they feed them some grain.  Whenever they get milked, they get fed some grain.  [Attendee #2] So, it's okay to give grain to them? [Aajonus] Absolutely.  They're built to eat that. They're built to eat high carbs. [Attendee] I just thought my knees swelling might've been from all the sugar from the grains. [Aajonus] Yeah, well, it's high in minerals. All milk is whether it's from a cow or goat, just from a goat there's even less fat than with a cow. Yeah, but there's not enough fat to disperse and to get it out properly.  [Kathy] How come you went to New Mexico?  Any reason?  [Aajonus] Doesn't matter. [Attendee #2] 85% percent of the time, the grain fed to animals is sprayed. It's toxic grain. [Aajonus] We're talking about grain is fine, but you're talking about pesticides and stuff like that.  That's something different, but you have to understand that most of the grasses that are fed these animals too.  'cause they're fed alfalfa during the winter. You know, bales of alfalfa, 90% of its's sprayed too. Just like the grain. [Attendee] Even in New Zealand, in New Zealand? [Aajonus] No.

Aajonus Can't Give Himself Parasites

I could never breed them. You know, I tried to spike myself with them and I couldn't get him to live. After the chemotherapy, I was so poisoned that anything that tried to live in my body would die.

Aajonus Eats Half A Pound Of Butter A Day

[2004] Depends upon the individual.  I eat a half a cup a day.  So half a pound a day minimum. Plus my cream.

Aajonus Likes The Taste Of Grain Fed Beef

Acid Reflux From Poisons Dumping Into Stomach

That's usually severe delipidization.

Means in your digested track and your sinuses, you may be dumping a lot of cauterized minerals from your days of cooked food.

So, they store in your esophagus and in your sinus and your stomach.

Well, when you eat.

No matter what you eat, the sinuses and the esophagus and the stomach will start dumping some of those into the food.

Acid reflux is that problem to the extreme.

So, it'll dump it into whatever food you have.

That's why I say you always need to eat fat with whatever food you're going to eat, so that those poisons don't go into the meat and the other nutrients because you won't be able to utilize them.

Once those portions get into there, they neutralize the acidity and the digested juices and destroy bacteria.

So, the villa don't work properly anymore, so that food will not be digested.

So, if you're eating butter, cream, eggs or something to fat with whatever food you're eating, so that fat will absorb those poisons so that you can utilize your food.

Otherwise, you will not.

You're not likely to to digest and utilize very much of it.

Alzheimers Patients Forget To Drink Water

[Aajonus] Do you have a question? [Attendee] Uhh, yeah. I had a talk with this guy.  He claims that people with Alzheimer's disease drink very little water and so in order to cure this problem, he put them on a 20 day fast and they drink about a gallon a day of water. And he claims And he says talking to some of these people some of them haven't had a glass of water in 15 years. Now I know you don't like too much water.  [Aajonus] Well, in a situation like that, it's a temporary good fix because the water, like I said, is leaching.  You know, so they have a mineral buildup, if they a plaquing in their system that's blocking the neurological system, the lymph, or the circulatory system, the bloodstream.  Drinking a lot of water like that can cause a lot of dissolution of that plaque, those minerals.  But also what does it do to the blood in the glandular system and everything else?  So, they might be able to get away with doing it once or twice in their life, but not as a regular thing.  [Attendee] Yeah, he's not doing this all the time. Yeah, this this is a one time fix.  [Aajonus] Yeah, it's a one time fix, but it won't relieve it forever.  [Attendee] Yeah, if they don't drink water, it may come back even. [Aajonus] Even if they drink while it'll come back.  But it is a temporary fix that can be utilized in certain situations.  [Attendee] But the doctors don't have any solution [Aajonus] They don't have any solution to anything.

Black Plague From Toxins, Coal Factories, Mercury

[Lewis]

Yeah, it runs the treatments that is that.

[Aajonus]

It's from the high toxicity in the person and then when they take a drug or medication it weakens their body.

And they usually go in anaphylaxis, which is a shock.

And they die.

But of course the medical professionals isn't going to take blame for that.

Because then you'd sue them.

And they'd be blamed for everything that they do cause.

Try to do that with.

[Attendee]

So, if the person has rabies, that they just suffered the symptoms and never got an injection they could survive.

[Aajonus]

Correct.

But in the old days when they use to treat because you know you have foaming of the mouth because usually that particular bacteria is is familiar to the nervous system is like syphilis, so it can dissolve brain tissue quickly.

And if you've been a person who grew up, let's say.

A lot of people who got, you know lung disease, black lung disease were the people who lived in London around the smoking factories.

So, they got the black plague because they were around this heavy rlead and metal fog everyday breathing it, so lungs were heavily damaged. So, it wasn't the bacteria that was associated with the detoxification. There was the actual poison metals that were dissolving their lung tissue.

Of course, technology in those days you know you got silver, chalices and stuff like that.

It's supposed to be gorgeous and beautiful, full of mercury.

Got the smelting factories around and everybody thinks it's advanced society, you know, so you don't want to give it up.

You're not going to admit what it does.

[Attendee]

And the thing about historical stories that....

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it didn't have anything to do with it.

Smoking factors and also when they were burning the cats, they were putting a lot of toxins in the air.

They were burning everything.

Jerusalem had it right. You know in Jerusalem during Christ time; the garbage collectors were the pigs.

They were sacred.

You could not eat them.

You could not kill them; they'd run around the streets and-

Bloodshot Eyes From Sleeping

[2004] [Lewis] Yes, I noticed I go into sleep about mid evening and that's fine.  I know I'm detoxing and healing. And afterwards when I wake up.  I notice a lot of redness, bloodshot in my eyes. What is that? [Aajonus] That's usually the brain detoxifying heavy metals out your tear ducts.  [Lewis] Right since I've had a history of metal.

Brain Has Most Toxins In The Body

[Aajonus] The toxins ago secrete out the eyes and the ears and the sinuses are all from the brain.  And the brain has the most toxic collection of minerals than any other part of the body.  Your body needs metallic metals and other minerals to transfer light, which is neurotic transmission. So, the brain collects a lot of heavy metals.  When they have to discharge, they discharge out the head, the throat, the gums. All that heavy plaquing on your teeth.  Those are cauterized minerals, some cooked foods collected in the brain and they're discharging.  And there may be bacteria in it, they're may not. Depending on how many cells are alive in your brain to be able to discharge some bacteria.  [Attendee] Is there a remedy for that?  [Aajonus] Is there a remedy? Lots of cheese with butter to relieve the constipation. Equal amounts of butter.  Yes, it is a cheesecake.

Carpets

[Aajonus]

New carpets if you don't have cotton or wool carpets, you've got toxic plastic in your environments it's like wearing plastic clothes.

Anything that isn't cotton, silk, or wool; you are going to breathe plastic particles, lint!

You take a synthetic, whether it's some pine needles or whatever. You take the synthetic material, and you shake it in the light, you'll see all this plastic dust all over the place.

The lint is plastic.

Do you think that your lungs can break that plastic down?

No way!

So, your carpet. You see that the carpet in my house, the synthetic is covered with either wool or cotton carpet every year.

[Kathy]

So, you can't vacuum it out?

You can't vacuum continually?

[Aajonus]

You'd have to vacuum 24 hours a day, all day long.

[Kathy]

It's not a carpet, it's a synthetic rug.

[Aajonus]

That is a plastic epoxy that gets into your lungs.

It's part of the fiber.

You cannot digest that.

We knowingly breathe plastic?

[Attendee]

Is it okay if we use a natural organic wool?

[Aajonus]

Well, if it's if it's from wool, period, if it's from an animal your body can break it down.

It's used to disassembling animal cells, whether it's hair or what. Our bodies spent millions of years adapting to that, the plastic no.

[Attendee]

Linen?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but it will be a little bit more difficult because they use high heat to solidify it and the fats in vegetable oils harden in the human system.

It's harder to breakdown, it isn't as bad as plastic, but it's not as good.

Thank you.

Causes and Remedies For Eye Problems

[Eric] Eric, actually I had a real question and a quick novelty question that I think.  The real one is what's your take on the causes and the remedies for the atheroma's that sometimes people develop under their eyes or in various places like that that. Fat deposits. [Aajonus] Just remember that poisons storing the fats. If your eyes, if your body is using your eyes as a detoxification center, the tear ducts.  Fatty deposits will normally form.  If they don't, you're in trouble.  Because the eyes will be terribly affected if they are, and you can see people with very bulging eyes.  And then all this sunken around them, they usually end up with a severe eye condition later in life, that's high pressure and like glaucoma, and cause a lot of problems, headaches continually throughout their life, irritability.  But anywhere where you have fat collections.  That is the body throwing poisons into those areas. If it's around the eyes.  Like Laurie, when I first met her she had huge bags under her eyes. She also cancer in three parts of her body, she was ultra thin. Over the years it's diminished.  She doesn't have that bulging. And her father had it too tremendously. Now, usually the toxins that go secrete out the eyes.  And the ears-

Chlorine and Bromine In A Hot Tub

[Attendee]

What do you think about hot tubs? They probably have bromine and chlorine in them.

[Aajonus]

Well, my hot tub back there.

I just use sand in this filter. I don't use any chemicals, just sand in the filter

Yep, I use a 200 pound sand filter.

I like my algae.

I breed the algae and make sure the algae is full in there. It's beneficial to the skin.

And it helps feed the skin.

If the algae is eating the dead cells on the skin, then you don't need salmonella on the skin.

Salmonella dries me out too much.

But that's our normal cleanser.

Salmonella eats the dead cells on your skin to break them off and get rid of them.

So, salmonella is very important to have on the skin. But if you live in an environment where you can have algae eat those dead cells instead of the salmonella, then your skin doesn't get as dry, or my skin doesn't get as dry.

Not right now, it's too hot. I use it to get cool right now.

About 105 degrees. Unless James gets in it, then it goes to 106-109. No one can sit in it, but him. laughs

Cholesterol Book

[Aajonus]

Good, you'll be healthier than most people.

[Attendee]

I've been reading about that, but I feel absolutely the other way.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, just get rid of It, propaganda. Like I said, get the book, it's called The Cholesterol Myth.

You read that book and you'll be cured.

Get that book and read it.

[Attendee #2]

I didn't hear the question.

[Aajonus]

She said she has high cholesterol levels, and she worries about the high cholesterol levels because when she eats the diet it makes a higher cholesterol.

Did you have a 700 cholesterol level? I might be concerned.

That's a good amount. I like 350 to 400.

[Attendee]

High cholesterol's healthy?

[Aajonus]

That's right.

You have to understand on this diet, even if you're not on this diet.

Still healthy to have a high cholesterol.

Because the fats bind with the poisons.

If you are fat deficient in your blood and you have a low fat level, guess where the poisons are going to go? Into the cells.

The red and white blood cells, you're going to transfer less oxygen.

You're going to have more problems.

So, ahigh cholesterol level is good, it's just that the food industry like to jump on this thing about, well, we can sell now our foods calling them low cholesterol, like cereals and other garbage.

[Attendee #3]

What's the book called?

[Aajonus]

The Cholesterol Myth. It's referenced in my recipe book.

OK, don't worry about be happy, because remember when you're on this diet, at least 50% of the cholesterols that are in your blood are going to be toxic ones that are on their way out.

Citrus Oil

But it won't harm him?  [Aajonus]  Oh, it could harm him, but it would healthfully harm him.  Yeah, but you know, usually in citrus oils, it's one of the most potent solvent oils. You use it to make turpentine.   You know, so it's a very good solvent.   So, while he's young, he's probably breaking some very toxic oils down from.   Especially if he's eaten some cooked vegetables.   We'll break it down.   Mostly from citrus peel.

Clothing Detergent Biokleen

No, I use biokleen from grape seed oil, grapefruit seed oil.

Cockroaches

[Aajonus]

But I never known.

Anybody on this raw diet that had a roach problem.

I had a late summer.

[Kathy]

About roaches, what do you do about roaches?

[Aajonus]

Cause I never had a roach problem before.

Well, like I say, I been on this diet and even when I lived in Beverly Hills, they have the worst roach problem in the world they called Palmetto bugs in Beverly Hills.

Well, let me tell you, I was in a in a building where the roaches, I mean big big roaches with 90 year old woman that had an apartment above me and her place was- I mean 1 drawer I opened... there were 1000 roaches in one drawer.

Under her sink there were at least 3000 roaches.
I had none in my apartment and my apartment was right next to her.

[Attendee]

Well, what do you think explains it?

The guy is not serial, they're outside of it, so.

[Aajonus]

They like cooked decaying food. Cooked decaying food is what they live on.

[Attendee #2]

That's what she had all over her house?

[Aajonus]

Cooked, yeah.

Yep, they love that.

They love cereals, they love anything cooked.

[Attendee]

I heard if you leave a leaf on the floor, they'll be attracted, they'll smell that?

[Aajonus]

That's bullshit, that's bullshit. They love mold.

[Attendee #2]

I used to have an apartment, I had roaches and I knew they didn't clean it properly.

I pulled the stove out and it was filthy and once I cleaned under that stove, I had no more roaches, but in Hawaii, the roaches were so big you could put saddles on them.

It's a really good way if you really have a lot of roaches is you just get empty jars and you put a little bit of oil.

Any kind of oil like here on the inside of the jar only at the top and then you put a little bit of stale beer in the bottom, and they go in after the beer, but then they can't climb out cause of the oil and then they just fill up the jars.

Coconut Cream With Meat or Fruit

If I want to, I usually don't have coconut cream with meat I usually save my coconut cream to have with fruit in the afternoon.

Cod Liver Oil Solvent Extracted

[Aajonus] It's not raw. [Kathy] That Jacob Miller has cod liver oil [Aajonus] There's no cod liver oil that isn't solvent processed. [Kathy] You know I'm talking about.  Is that he has a listing of items. [Aajonus] I don't care, that cod liver oil is just as toxic as any other. Cold pressed doesn't make any difference with solvent treated.  They purify it with a solvent.

Cold Feet Takes 15 Years To Heal

[Attendee] My feet tend to be cold. [Aajonus] It's usually a bone marrow problem. So, the bone marrow in your feet are probably pretty acid and pretty toxic. So, that would be a matter of applying hot water bottles at night.  Get the circulation to change, and that usually takes 10 to 15 years change.  It's a long one, it's a long and slow one. With me with my blood and bone cancer, the feet were the last thing to change and they did it in the last two years.  This particular ankle right here, the rest of my body could be completely warm, but this would feel like it came right out of the freezer.  And I would have to wrap it, bundle it.  [Kathy] Now it's better? [Aajonus] Yeah, now this last two years is the first winter where I didn't have a problem.  It's fine, yeah. [Kathy] Can you wear socks? You can't wear socks with it? Yeah, you can wear socks. Anytime you want. [Attendee] I'll tell you I bought these sandals 3 months ago and this is the first.  [Aajonus] They're warming up.  It takes a long time.  [Attendee #2] What about numbness in your feet.  If you move your toes and it feels kinda numb. [Aajonus] Dead cells. Not enough fat to collect the toxicity, so it's gone into the nerves.  No cramping can be a mixture of a lot of different things. Cramping can be dehydration.  It can be collection of toxic minerals, attractive substances too much carbohydrate byproducts, acrylamides that collect in the muscles.

Cold Pressed Coconut Oil

[Attendee] The organic cold pressed coconut.  [Aajonus] There's no such thing as unheated coconut.  They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, that's bullshit.

Cows Dig Up Ground Eat Roots, etc

Buffalo will pull up a whole field of potatoes if he gets ahold of one. Put it into a field of potatoes and the cow will dig it up.  That's why you put rings on the nose of pigs and cows.

Cream relievs urehtra pain

[Aajonus] The nervous system detoxifies when there's no light and at night time. If you're in a climate you know like you're in, let's say, Finland.  In the summer, you know it's light all day long you will still detoxify.  Normally when the sun is the lowest.  And the nervous system detoxifies.  Like I said, in the nervous system, in the brain.  That has the most free radicals, heavy metals.  What happens if the free radicals touch cells, it burns them.  Gets into the blood, gets into the kidneys.  Gets into the bladder, causes irritation through the urethra into the bladder walls.  You have to relieve it, you have to get it out quickly.  Only way you can help resolve that is to drink a lot of cream before you go to sleep.  That will help ease it.  [Attendee] I've been drinking my juice before bed. [Aajonus] Eliminate the juice and have let's say, like 2-3 ounces of cream with your juice.  [Attendee] Well, not that much.  [Aajonus] OK, then you gotta cut it out because the minerals and the juice are helping you eliminate from the neurological system at night.  If you're not sleeping well, it would be better that you didn't detoxify that quickly.  Cream is always good to help.  Bind with those acrid minerals that cause irritation to the tissue.  2-3 oz Yep, Yep.  If I drink a vegetable juice, I urinate 5 minutes later. With... intensity! Specially now that I'm so thin.  When I get the weight back on, it won't be as bad.  When you're as thin as me, you can't even move with that kind of mineral toxicity.

Detoxing old sugar with sugarcane juice

[2004]

[Aajonus]

OK, alright OK we're gonna get started now.

Now first I'm gonna tell you the book that I've been working on next is detoxification.

And I get a lot of people from the Internet.

You know the Yahoo groups who talk about heavy detoxification and doing heavy detoxification.

So, my methods of detoxification are usually to take a food that you've eaten in the years of eating cooked foods.

You ferment it and eat it. What you are doing is introducing bacteria that is absent in the food that you've eaten cooked.

So, you've got no way to recycle it out of the body.

So, your body has to make solvents like virus to dissolve that toxicity and remove it gradually, very gradually and slowly.

So, in the detoxification book, I'm telling people how to gradually detoxify.

And that's why I'm taking those foods, how to ferment them and how to eat them and in what quantities.

So, two weeks ago I decided to push the envelope to see how much of the detoxification was too much.

[Attendees]

Laughs

[Aajonus]

I did it.

While I was in Vietnam three weeks ago, they have sugar cane juice.

You could get it anywhere, almost anywhere in Asia, and of course I was a sugar junkie.

I was diabetic and I would put down a whole box of chocolate covered cherries in one afternoon.

You know lots of candy and lots of powdered Donuts.

And I loved all that stuff.

I was a sugar freak.

Became diabetic.

So, I decided that I was going to detox the sugar that has been in my system.

So, I fermented the sugar cane juice.

Well, I had diarrhea for about 5 days on and off.

While I was in Vietnam, during that I got tremendous hives everywhere and I used to get hives all the time so badly that it burned my skin and it'd blister, and scabs would fall off.

And it was mainly around my kidneys, all the places where a diabetic is most effected.

So, it was all along here, I had huge marks still coming out my ass.

I lost mine complete ass, dropped in a week.

I had this beautiful round ass, and it was gone in a week.

But sugar was stored in these tissues. It's not there! No ass!

Second thing to do, I was also a heavy milk drinker, pasteurized milk drinker.

So, two weeks ago I decided to drink an intense amount of fermented milk.

That was two weeks fermented, so it smelled like alcohol.

It burned my lungs if I inhaled it.

So, I drank 2 ½ cups of it at one time. I was on the toilet for three days, 72 hours.

[Attendee]

Is that raw milk?

[Aajonus]

Raw milk.

And again, it caused that kind of detoxification, but that wasn't my ass, lost my ass.

I also lost about 20 pounds in about four days.

So, I put 10 pounds back on, so I don't look so bad as I did four days ago, but he kicked my butt, so I kind of see the limitation.

So, all these people on the Internet who say go for it.

Heavy detoxifications, I don't suggest to do. Not unless you're 50 pounds overweight.

You can afford to lose that much weight.

It was too much for me to lose, I was debilitated.

I could barely move for about two or five days.

You know, just diarrhea and the exhaustion and the weight loss.

And getting back up to this weight, I've been eating all day long every day.

Food and food and food and food and cheesecakes galore.

And cheesecakes help absorb that toxicity.

I had less rashes, less hives when I would eat the cheesecake, so I'd make a cheesecake for about 3 days.

And eat pieces all along the day throughout the day.

So, that's what I have to say about the detoxification before the book comes out. Don't push anything too heavily. You're going to ferment something to detoxify that that's in your body, something you've eaten a lot of in your past life, cooked life.

No more than an ounce or two ounce every time with that particular food.

Don't push it.

Unless, you know you've got a lot of weight.

You know, then you could probably afford to do it, but still, if you have to work, you're not going to be able to function very well.

If you have that kind of a detoxification, OK, any questions about that?

[Jeff]

Even if you eat something from your past, is it necessarily pulling out the old stuff?

[Aajonus]

Well, what I did was I had some of my feces checked while I was in Vietnam.

I got a laboratory to check it and it was a lot of old toxic cauterized sugar in there from that.

And here it was metals.

When I had the milk, it caused a bunch of metals to come out of my system.

And I started forming stones in my urine.

You know, so it caused a heavy mineral detoxification.

Detoxing through skin, dry skin etc

[Attendee] Tell us a bit about it because detoxing through the skin. Can it cause symptoms like dry skin, itchy skin, chapped lips and warts? [Aajonus] Absolutely. That's why I like the primal facial body care cream. If you're going through any kind of a skin detox, any kind of a rash, dry skin period. Poisons are leaving through your skin. In an intense amount it's drying out the surrounding cells. There's not enough fat in those cells, so when the toxin moves past it, it draws the fat outt of that cell and that cell will crack and damage and scar. So, with the primal facial body care cream on. It will be able to be absorbed into the surrounding cells. So, you don't have as much damage. I mean, if I hadn't put that on these areas, I would have huge sores and huge scars. [Kathy] You make it up? [Aajonus] Yeah, you make it up, it's on page 145 of the recipe book. [Attendee #2] How long is it good for? [Aajonus] I've had it up to six months in the refrigerator. I've had it up to two months out of the refrigerator in a climate like Thailand at the [Attendee #2] Throw it away after? [Aajonus] No, I've always used it within six months.

Diet For Over Acidic Gums

[Attendee] And what about the gums and stuff? [Aajonus] Gums, you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system, going out the teeth. So keep honey and butter in your mouth. You absorb those acids. Or cream, keep a little bit of cream in your mouth. Honey/butter mixture. It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth.

Different meat sdifferent bacteria

[Kathy] Then why are you going into different meats to make high chicken, high beef, all these other things. [Aajonus] Because there's a different bacteria for each meat, there are thousands of bacteria, which you want to try to get them all going. [Kathy] High fish will help you digest fish, right? [Aajonus] Yes, correct. There's a whole array of bacteria for each meat. And if you breed those and introduce those to your body, you're going to digest that.

Don't Drink Vege Juice At Night

[Attendee] Can you say you prefer the green juice before you go to bed? [Aajonus] It all depends upon the individual. I give guidelines in the book, four juices a day, one before you go to sleep at night. If you're a person who gets hyperactive from drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice. You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, and go to sleep. [Attendee #2] In the middle of the night, take a milkshake. [Aajonus] If you wake. Yeah.

Don't Go Longer Than 5 Hours Without Eating

Don't Sit In Sun With Dry Skin

[Aajonus] Well, if your skin is dry, you don't want to sit in the sun without the Primal Facial Body Care Cream or coconut cream. [Attendee] What about coconut oil? [Aajonus] If it's raw coconut oil that you make yourself, it's great. That's what the natives always used for thousands and thousands of years, just break coconut juice. They would grate the coconut meat and ring out the fat, apply it and eat it. [Kathy] The organic cold pressed coconut. [Aajonus] There's no such thing as unheated coconut. They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, bullshit, not raw.

H Pylori

[2004] [Aajonus] H. Pylori is part of the stomach lining, we've had it for billions of years, all animals. Again, the medical profession is trying to blame everything that's disease on bacteria, but we lived with these bacteria for millions of years without disease. Why is everybody getting ulcers now. Ulcers were unheard of before coffee became into existence. Now that coffees around, ulcers are normal thing. And again, if you have an ulcer, you're going to have pylori bacteria in the tissue, but that didn't cause the problem, whatever poisoned the stomach lining created the ulcer. [Attendee] What do you do? How do you get rid of the flatulence, the indigestion or whatever? [Aajonus] That's what I mean, my detoxification book is going to get into foods that are fermented, they can start breaking these things down, Yeah. That's what my book is going to go into hopefully without killing anybody. [Kathy] Raw sauerkraut? [Aajonus] Again, I'm not going to give any specifics on any of that until I finish all my work and research, because for some people, it's sauerkraut, particular person a particular amount. So, you don't want to dive into this unless you know what you're doing. Um, you get one question first and then we get around. Yeah.

High Fish Neurological Detox

[Aajonus] When I experimented with high fish in stages, eating too much at one time, it can cause a heavy neurological detoxification. It is rare, but it could happen, and it happened to me. It caused a meningitis. It crippled me for about five days, but I'm not your average guy, I'm sickly. [Attendee] Was it bacterial or viral? [Aajonus] Bacterial. Let me repeat it. Bacteria in high meat is for digesting meat. It's not for detoxifying the system.

Honey Breaks Down Protein and Per Day

[Attendee] And put it on there and it almost liquifies it. [Aajonus] Dissolves it. That's why I say, if you're going to eat honey, you need a certain amount of protein in a day. Like in the recipe book, because people were eating too much honey and not eating the meat and they were getting protein deficient. So, that's why I say you could have six tablespoons of honey a day. If you're eating a pound of meat, if you're not eating a pound of meat, you have to reduce it proportionally the amount of honey that you consume. [Kathy] You can't just have a tablespoon of honey in the morning? ⁠[Aajonus] It's not a good idea. It's always good to have it with food, not by itself. No, you don't have to have that much, honey. It's up to you. It's up to your digestion. If you're digesting fine, you don't need a lot of honey, but if everything's very slow digesting, you should be having honey throughout the day. [Attendee] Is that all the honey does? Help digestion, does it have any other benefits. ⁠[Aajonus] That's just about it, digestion. That's why the bears love it. The bears can digest so much food, so quickly. They can gain a tremendous amount of weight. And if they're not gaining the weight, you can better believe they're going to go into a hive, they will invade a hive. If a bear is having trouble gaining weight, he knows he's not going to make it through hibernation. So, he will go in and suffer all the stings in the eyes he can take to eat that honey, so he can digest all the foods. [Attendee] Because he hibernates, that's why another animal wouldn't necessarily do that. [Kathy] But you can't just have a lick of the honey with some lemon juice. ⁠[Aajonus] It's not a good idea to have stuff like that. Damaging the teeth and the system. If you're gonna dilute it, dilute it in some water. Yeah. You know the lemonade, the lemon, the honey, the water and the cream together. [Kathy] Oh, the water on the mineral water. Yeah. [Attendee] With honey, you are consuming a lot of raw honey. You should always consume a little more raw protein right? ⁠[Aajonus] Exactly, that's what I'm saying. [Attendee #2] What's honey made of? ⁠[Aajonus] Honey is nectar, nectar from a flower, pussy juice.

Honey Per Day Aajonus

[Aajonus] I eat my six tablespoons a day, if I eat a pound of meat. If I eat more than a pound of meat, I can eat up to proportionally, whatever I could eat up to a cup a day if I have three pounds of meat a day, by the way. [Attendee] By the way Aajonus, I ordered two [unclear size] of raw Tupelo [Aajonus] Oh yeah, it's hard to get unheated though. [Attendee] Totally unheated, raw. [Aajonus] Tupelo is so thick. [Attendee] Yeah, I Understand. This 90 year old man has been doing it for a long time and it's totally raw. [Aajonus] Tupelo is highest because there's a particular nutrient in the Tupelo flower, in the nectar that even allows the bees to produce more insulin. So, it is even easier for diabetics to eat, it's a slower metabolized. It's slower and metabolized. [Kathy] So, if you're eating meat, have a tablespoon of honey every time? [Aajonus] ⁠ I do definitely. I always have honey with my meat.

Honey With Butter Doesn't Count To Honey Limit

[Aajonus] That's if you're having the honey and butter mixture after an egg [Attendee] The moisturizing formula is not enough honey, that's all I had? [Aajonus] The honey and the butter doesn't count. It doesn't count. [Kathy] It doesn't count your honey and your meat? [Aajonus] No, because it's mixed in with the butter. The formula it's already attached to that medium. [Kathy] So, you need an additional tablespoon with each meat meal? [Aajonus] Correct.

Hot Bath Ingredients

[2004] [Aajonus] Uh, usually I suggest -two to three cups of milk per bath -two tablespoons of sun dried sea salt -two to four tablespoons of raw, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. Those will help magnetize the poisons in your connective tissue and in your lymph, out through your skin. [Kathy] Why is that 2-4? [Aajonus] It depends on how toxic your water is. [Kathy] So, generally in LA it should be more toxic? [Aajonus] if you're in the valley, it's less toxic than LA note. Milk, salt and vinegar, 2-4 tablespoons.

How Long After Meat To Eat Honey

As soon as I finished with the meat, I can have the honey. I may wait, but I usually have it immediately.

How Long To Regenerate Body Parts

[2004] [Aajonus] No. And it's from when I started welting up, the toxins started moving out through my skin, a little bit too much. Sugar stays in your body three years at four, I said, it takes 40 years to clean out every cell in your body. Five times, it takes five times. According to Pottengers and Howells work. Takes five generations to clean the body out. Your blood takes 40 days. The skintakes two and a half years. Testes take two and a half years. The bones take seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell. You have to do that five times. Every cell in your body has to be replaced at least five times to get to the point where you're completely whole, whole, and natural and healthy. [Attendee] You mean you're not replacing them with good cells yet? [Aajonus] You take somebody who's not well, and when they reproduce, their offspring will not be so healthy. They'll have toxins built into it. Right. So, it takes 40 years for humans to go through that cycle, 40 years. In Howell and Pottenger's work, what they did was, as soon as the cat or rat reproduced, and the next offering was going, they would kill that animal and then perform autopsies and do tests on it to see the changes. And it took five generations. Well, we don't have to wait five generations of our offspring. We have to wait five generations and cellular transition. It's about 40 years. And that's if you're 100%, if you're not 100%, it could take a lifetime, you know, 50, 60, 80 years, all depends. And that all depends upon how healthy you want to be. I'm one of those who never wants to have another day of my own purposeful lack of energy and illness. I just don't want to have that. I want to see how healthy I can get and I'm only 21 years into my 40 years. So, I'm only halfway and I'm already satisfied. Even after I got my butt kicked, I still made it I'm here.

How Much Meat Can A Child Eat (x)

How To Get Rid Of Heavy Metals

Well, there are different things I recommend. -Coconut cream -Cilantro -Dark Berries

Ionizers Leave Room

[Aajonus] Yeah, but just make sure they're not on while you're in the room. [Attendee] Is there any other particular equipment you might like? [Aajonus] Your Alpine equipment is pretty good. [Attendee #2] How about a fan? [Aajonus] Make sure it's three feet from you because the EMF field. Just make sure you're not in the room when they're on. Because they will change the atomic structure of the air and it's not conducive to health. It burns nerve tissue.

LA Water

There's no way, unless you're, going to put those ingredients in water, then your body can't reabsorb it, but not like, even if you don't have those things in it, you're not likely to reabsorb what you've exhibited, but you're likely to absorb the chemicals are in the water.  If I get into LA city water, without those ingredients, I cannot stay in there longer than 7 minutes and I got to get out of there like I'd had 10 cups of coffee and I mean, I am buzzing, my heart's going 90 miles an hour and I'm just shaking. So, I can't do that. Here I've got my own well, so I don't' have all that problem.

Lymph System - Lymph massage

[Aajonus] To get that stuff liquid again. So, you can get it moving out of the lymph system. Because the lymph system is responsible for cleaning the body. And if the lymph system isn't moving, our arteries, heart congestion is going to keep collecting. [Attendee] Would lymph massage help? [Aajonus] No, lymph massage is the worst thing you can do. Lymph massage is a deep tissue massage. They go down, crack your veins in your circulatory system, your nerves and your lymph system. Rolfing is the worst, but any kind of deep tissue massage that isn't gradual. If they're going to go deep, they have to start lightly and move in slowly. So, they're not ripping and breaking things. I suggest that you do just the tickle therapy. If you take your hand and you go over your hair, you'll get a tingling, do it to each other. So over here, hair, on your arm said, hope tingled goes through your entire body. What more stimulation could you want that? When I have a massage, that's what I have them do. I have him do my entire body tickle therapy. You barely touch my skin. You just go over like that entire body. And it generates everything. The therapist when they're finished with me, they're more red than I am because they're getting all this energy from me as well.

Make up For Sleep By Sleeping More

She asked if you haven't been getting enough sleep. Can you make it up by sleeping more? Yes, you can, just remember that 90% of cellular division happens in the sleep state. So healing, 90% of the healing happens in the sleep. After I got my but kicked on this, I was sleeping 10, 12 hours a day. It was me, you know, I'm usually four and a half hours a day, person, five hours a day, maximum sleeping. [Kathy] Did you get up at a time and eat food? [Aajonus] Oh yes. I never slept more than three hours at a time. Four hours. Always like, of course I don't have to set an alarm. I got my own internal alarm.

Milk Alone High In Sugar

[Kathy] Or you can just have plain milk, right? [Aajonus] You can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar. Milk by itself isn't good at that hour It's high in sugar. [Lewis] What about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night? [Aajonus] Yeah, but that's at night. That's not when you're waking up after 5 hours. [Kathy] He said 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep and when you get up and have another 4 ounces, that's colostrum, is that like milk? [Aajonus] Colostrum is a little different than milk. It's very different from milk. If you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night you can have a glass of colostrum. Higher in fat and hormones, less sugar.

Milkshake Recipe

[Kathy] How many eggs do you have to make? [Aajonus] It all depends on me. You know, I got the recipe in the recipe book. -1 to 3 eggs

2 to 3 ounces of cream

3 to 5 ounces of milk Depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.

Monsanto Trying To Destroy Animals

[2004] [Aajonus] E.coli 157 is a fiction. Monsanto's trying to destroy all the animals in the world, so that any animal that you will get, they will have genetically engineered and patented. That way, if ever you have an animal that you raised, you have to pay them royalties. That is the whole idea.

Mother Not Producing Milk

[Attendee] The lady who showed us to have her baby in a hospital. And the doctor decided very quickly and with labor, she now has the baby and wants to nurse the baby. She is not producing enough. Now they're having a formula, any suggestions? [Aajonus] Lots of milk and eggs, milk, raw milk, a little bit of honey, a lot of cream. Oh yeah. This formula is very toxic. Mostly made with soy. Yeah, it works. If the mother is also getting enough other protein from eggs or meat, otherwise it doesn't work. I mean it will help them build porosity, but it doesn't help them build a good fat. She asked how many eggs a day I eat, anywhere from four to 20. [Attendee] You were talking about the baby formula, I wasn't breast fed. [Aajonus] So, that's the problem. I wasn't breast fed either, I'm a mess! [Attendees] Laughs [Attendee] And I was told by my doctor that I was a very fat baby. [Aajonus] Congratulations, a wonderful thing. A fat baby is a very protected baby, a skinny baby is one where the brain will be damage by any toxins that enter the body. I like fat babies, I like fat people.

Mucus Discharges Poisons

Depends on what's causing it. I mean if it's heavy metals coming out through your mucous membranes, you're not going to stop it. All you can do is just produce enough mucus to keep it from being problem. And that means eating lots of eggs with dairy to create enough mucus to protect your mucous membrane. But I can see by the whites of your eyes, that you have a lot of toxicity in your bone marrow, that means you have a lot of heavy metals in your bone marrow, and that's going to create a problem in any of these bones right here, you're going to detox out of your sinuses. So, you're going to have an allergy problem all your life, until all that's relieved. So, the only thing you can do is make sure that you produce enough mucus to protect those mucus membrane and to discharge the poisons.

Need To Gain Weight - Over Acidity

[Attendee] I have this acid reflux that causes this cough continually after I eat, when I lay down at night. My teeth, my gums are bleeding continually. [Aajonus] You're way too thin. You don't have any fat to bind with anything. So, all these acids are getting into your blood, into your lymph and to your neurological system. They're burning your system. You have to get fat in a condition like that. [Attendee] I'm eating lots, I've been on it 16 months. [Aajonus] Not enough. I mean, you should be 30 pounds heavier with that kind of condition. [Attendee] I put on 60-70 pounds. I took off 10 of that already. I mean, I didn't try. [Aajonus] I'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition, like that, it permeates their system, unless there is that excessive fat in the blood, lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be saved. You're always going to have symptoms.

Nervous System Detoxes At Night

No Fruit Afte 6 In Afternoon

[2004] I tell people to eat their fruit in the afternoon and not after six, seven o'clock. Cause it could disturb the whole system after.

No Green Juices After 6PM

No Honey After High Meat

[2004] [Kathy] Even after high meat, you can have the honey with your mate 20 minutes later. [Aajonus] If I'm having high meat, I wait 15 minutes before I eat my regular meat meal. I have my high meat, wait 15 minutes to have my regular meat meal and then wait until I finish the meat meal before I have my honey.

No Milk&Honey&Butter With High Meat

[2004] [Aajonus] That's why I say, you don't have a honey with high meat. You don't have milk with high meat either, the lactic acid in the milk will destroy the bacteria. [Attendee] Can you drink it down with water? [Aajonus] I don't drink it down with anything, but you can with water if you're going to do anything use water. I just chew it and down it. Yeah, then I'll rinse my mouth out if I don't like the taste, but I like the taste. I like it. It's not a problem, but never take butter with high meat

No Vegetable Juice For Children

[2004] [Aajonus] Uh, because children have a lot of HGA, which is human growth hormone. You know, when we reached 21, 25, we stop producing it. If we don't eat raw meat, we're never going to manufacture it again. We eat raw meat than we will, and we will still continue to have growth hormones. But children, even if they don't eat meat, they have growth hormones, 99% of them. What that causes is an alkaline condition in there blood. So, if they drink the vegetable juice, they become too over alkaline, then they become repulsed to meat and even to dairy, and then they won't eat those foods and then they get cranky. They start going for sugars and then it's unruly and unmanageable. And then it's when you don't want to have children laughs. So, you don't want them to have vegetable juice, but maybe one day a week. And then you can usually tell they get a little red around the mouth and they're getting a little acidic, a little red around the eyes, red around the ears, they're getting over acid, but it only takes one cup and their back, even a half a cup for a child that size. So, you need to use much parsley and children's juice should be only maybe 5% parsley and 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber. The parsley causes them to get really alkaline, overly alkaline in their intestines and blood. That's the most alkalinizing besides concrete. So, it has to be minimized. [Attendee] You say they tend to lose their appetite when they become over alkaline? [Aajonus] Yes , when your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline, you lose appetite for meat. You just start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars. [Attendee] If you had the juice and you don't have an appetite after the juice, it could that you are over alkaline? [Aajonus] Too much for you. Then you shouldn't be drinking that much juice, or you should skip that particular juice at that time of day.

Over Alkalinity - No Craving For Meat

[Aajonus] Over alkaline, yes. When your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline you lose your appetite for meat. You start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars. [Attendee] So, if you have the juice and don't have any appetite after the juice it could be that your are becoming over alkaline? [Aajonus] Too much for you, you shouldn't be drinking that much juice or you should skip that particular juice at the time of day.

Overacidity & Slant Bed Upwards

[2004] [Aajonus] I'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition like that, it permeates their system, unless there's that excessive fat in the blood lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be safe. You're always going to have symptoms. And if you sleep, you better sleep at a slant. [Attendee] I tried that. [Aajonus] Well, it keeps the lungs from collapsing, if you're lying straight the acids seep into the lungs. The lungs can collapse and be hard to breathe properly. When you've got it at a slant, you don't have the gravitational weight as a hindrance to breathing. You're elevated like this, feet are this way, the legs are this way and the bodies at an angle. [Attendee] I tried that didn't do any good, lifted the head in my bed. [Aajonus] But you had your feet down this way. If you lifted the whole bed than the whole beds at this angle [Attendee] No, I lifted just the head of the bed. [Aajonus] How can you lift just the head? If you're lifting the head of the bed, the whole bed is gonna crank. [Attendee] There were bricks underneath it. [Aajonus] Here's the bed, you put bricks under here, the whole beds gonna slant upward. What you have to do is you have to get the bed like a hospital bed, this level where you're from the waist up at a high angle what you can do is get one of those rectangular shaped pillows or put on your body or use three pillows to layer it. So, you're at that angle. [Attendee] And what about the gums and stuff? [Aajonus] I say you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system going out the teeth. So, keep honey and butter in your mouth. You absorb those acids or cream to keep a little bit of cream in your mouth. Honey & butter mixture. It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth acid. What acid fruit are you talking about tomato? Grapefruit is fine. It all depends upon the individual. I tell people to their their fruit in the afternoon and not after 6-7 o'clock because it could interrupt the whole system.

Parasites, Tapeworms

[Aajonus] A tapeworm lives in the intestines on high carbs. So, as long as you're discarding high-carbohydrate waste into your intestine. Those are going to be your friends. The tapeworm only lives in a third world environment where there's only grains. [Kathy] Somebody said that when they got the monkfish livers that they found worms in it. They would find worms in the monkfish or red snapper. [Aajonus] Those are not tapeworms, we're talking about a tapeworm. [Attendee] But my one was like, it was like a round worm.. [Aajonus] Pinworm, that lives on the intestinal walls. It lives in the intestinal walls like it does in the tripe of the chicken and what they are eating is toxic protein. [Attendee] Why does my one come out? [Aajonus] It probably got too toxic. [Attendee] Maybe because of the raw diet? [Aajonus] No. It's like I say, lives on your intestinal walls. It doesn't have anything to do with what you're eating. Tapeworm lives on what you're eating, pinworm lives on your intestinal walls because of the toxicity. You need to have them. If you don't have the pinworm, your intestines could go into cancer. [Attendee] So, there's no danger from them going to organs and things like that? [Aajonus] If you ate just cooked carbohydrates your entire life, possible. Infiltrates the tissue, or if you got poisoned by something that would completely destroy the integrity of cellular divisions it could. But that would take a mass poisoning right there. Say a fish gets into an area with high mercury contamination or high radioactivity...

Parsely Too Alkaline For Children

So, you don't need to use much parsley in children's juice. Should be only maybe 5% parsley and, you know, 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber. The parsley causes them to get really alkaline. Overly alkaline in the intestine and blood, that's the most alkalizing thing beside concrete, so it has to be minimized.

Pasteurized Milk & Osteoporosis

[Aajonus] You have to understand that pasteurized milk causes a lot of osteoporosis and a lot of hardening of the bone. A lot of people get broken bones from eating pasteurized dairy because of the minerals that are cauterized. So concentrated in minerals that it collects in the system. When I had the fermented milk, it started clearing out of my tissues. A lot of those cauterized minerals. [Attendee] What would you use to detox old grains and breads? [Aajonus] You just take those grains. If you were eating rye bread, then you use rye. And you let them soak in a lot of water for about three days till they start fermenting and getting mold on them. Then you eat just a little bit of it, but you don't do a lot unless you want to go through a heavy detoxification. So I don't know how much I'm scarred. I still have, you know, the sore, you see the spots. You know, the little sore from where the hives came out and blistered my skin, see the dark spots. Uh, I've got them all over here and some on my chest. [Kathy] Like black spots? [Aajonus] Yeah, little dark spots. See them.

Peppermint Oil For Termites

[2004]  [Attendee]  Fumigating sounds bad, probably is bad. How do I get rid of these guys without having them destroy...  [Aajonus]  All you have to do is get some mint juice. Get some mint, like I grew up peppermint all around here, juice that and just start spraying it all around and it will soak into the wood and they cannot eat it now.  [Attendee]  Are they going to go somewhere else now er?  [Aajonus]  They'll go somewhere. Oh, kill them.   [Attendee]  Those are in there under the home because all I have remnants of is our waste, they built pinholes and they push the waste out. Inject down those holes or?  [Aajonus]  Yeah, get some mint juice and just start pouring it all around.  [Attendee #2]  Does actually growing the plant help?  ⁠[Aajonus]  Yeah, it does help. It will also keep ants away; ants will not burrow into ground where mint is growing.  [Attendee #2]  How long does it last?  ⁠[Aajonus]  If it soaks into the wood, it's forever. Especially if it has worm holes already in it.   [Attendee]  Boric acid powders?  ⁠[Aajonus]  Well, boric acid powders and if you breathe it, it can cause deteriorations of your respiratory system,  Yeah, but also it gases though, say if it rains and moisture gets into the framework, it gases, and you have to deal with those vapors.  These things were known naturally ages ago, they had fields of mint and they would just grind it into a liquid and just start dumping, treating the wood that way before it even got into a house.   [Attendee #3]  Oh, so they would build houses with mint treated wood?  ⁠[Aajonus]  Oh yeah. Egyptians were heavy with that when they didn't use rock, they preferred rock. But when they used wood, they were always mint treating.   [Attendee #4]  Using baking soda as a deodorant?  ⁠[Aajonus]  No, no, terrible! Diluted lemon juice is the best thing for that.

Places With Good Air Quality

[Attendee] Is there a way to kind of more on a localized basis to monitor air quality. In other words, I'm kind of looking for another place to live, but I want to pick some place where the air is better. You know what I mean? [Aajonus] Can't get better than this area and the further you go into the city, the more toxic you get. [Attendee] What about like Altadena, higher up? Are they better or not? [Aajonus] Terrible! There's a whole toxic layer that sits up there, right up on the mountain, halfway up the mountain. And that layer is probably 1500 feet thick. [Attendee] Wow, cause I was at the impression- [Aajonus] if you ever go up in a small plane and you look at the layers, you'll see. [Attendee #2] Best area you said? [Aajonus] Anywhere along the beach. [Attendee] Are there any like parts or anything, where do they actually do give you like a more specific report on the air? [Aajonus] They won't do that. Everybody would be discouraged. [Attendee] Yeah. Then how do you know? Just because your smell of the- [Aajonus] I used to do some tests. I took flight lessons. I saw the layers.

Poisons Collect In Fat & Organs

[Lewis] One time I thought I heard you say that poisons and hormones collect primarily in the organs of the animals- [Aajonus] Correct, in the fat, and the organs. [Lewis] Okay. So, uh, just how bad is the muscle. [Aajonus] It's not bad, most of the poisons go to the fat and the glands. That's why I won't eat glands from an animal, unless it's an organic animal.

Purpose Of High Meat - Digest Meat

[Kathy] Uh, when you're making high fish, what will the high fish do for you? What will it help? [Aajonus] Okay. Anytime you are making high meat, the whole purpose is for bacteria to break down the meat. Normally in our digestive tracts we have a lot of bacteria that breaks down meat. Not only hydrochloric acid, but bacteria, salmonella, E.coli. E.coli is the last final digestion of meat. And then E.coli is the most important bacteria there is. It helps you synthesize B-vitamins and amino acids. It takes that protein and breaks it down into the finest form. It's a backup for your immune system. When you take meat and you fill it full of bacteria, whether you're coating it with E.coli the E.coli breeds on it, what you are doing is introducing bacteria into your body that will help you digest meat, period. That's what it's for. If you want to go into detoxification, you have to ferment that meat severely. You have to let it go into a liquid where all the protein is already predigested by the bacteria and it's high in alcohol. That's a bacteria detoxification and that is an extremely hard point to get to. You have to let your meat sit for 6, 7, 8, 10 months before we will come become completely liquid like that. Bacteria in high meat is to help you to just meat, period. That is what it's for.

Raw Honey & Babies

[Aajonus] That's all, cause they don't know any better. ⁠When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it produces an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carb into enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly protein. So, it has the protein for digesting protein. It's like a solvent that helps break down cellular structures of meat and eggs. Anything that's high in protein. Once you heat it above 93 degrees, that is neutralized or destroyed, the hotter it gets the more destroyed. [Attendee] What degrees? [Aajonus] 93 degrees. See the bees fan the hive and keep it at 92.8. If the top of the hive goes above 92.8 for very long, for an hour and a half, they will abandon it. They will go to a lower area and they will never eat that honey, unless they're starving. [James] I was real skeptical, I deal with Honey Pacifica and Aajonus, I went to the hive desert with him, I stuck my hand in the hive. It was 109 degrees out, but the hive was 75. And many times we've watched the bees not to be able to keep the hive below 93 degrees, they're gone. So this is exactly right. [Aajonus] So, what happens is if the baby has a concentrated sugar without the insulin- See when the bees get back to the hive they vomit. So, honey is nectar predigested vomit. That's what honey is. Once it's heated, that insulin substance is neutralized. So, when it gets into the baby's system, it's too much sugar. It gets into the blood and nervous system and it can cause anaphylaxis just like a drug. And let me tell you most honeys are treated. They are filtered with a filter that has high chemical reactions in it. They're also subjected to cleansers. And then if the baby gets that poison, you go into an anaphylaxis shock. Unheated honey never has caused a problem and I had babies a month old. [James] Okay. The next thing to know is that there is no law. There is no legal description of what the word raw means, That includes cheese, honey, oil, cold pressed, and so if you go to a honey or a beekeeper. [Aajonus] They'll tell you it's raw because they believe it's raw. [James] Then when you go and check out their operation, it's heated to 120 degrees in the jar. They still don't believe that is heating. They believe it's warming. [Attendee #2] Cold pressed? [Aajonus] Cold spun. [Attendee #2] Is it okay to mix raw honey in a meat dish? [Aajonus] Absolutely. [James] Sometimes I got piece of tough meat or tough fat and I'll put a piece of honey on it and it almost dissolves it.

Sauna Too Hot

[Aajonus]  I like the idea of heat, but saunas I do not like, they're too hot. By the time they get through the third layer of skin, they damage the enzyme content in the skin and the vitamin content, and then start affecting the connective tissue. They also burn the mucous membrane.   Steam is the same thing; it can even be worse because that gets into the lungs. Because in the sauna you can clear the air by the time it gets past the bronchial, but with steam it will actually get into the lungs and damage the lung walls. So, hot baths, hot water bottles. That is what you should use to help yourself perspire to get rid of the poisons.  [Attendee]  What about setting the sauna at low temperatures?  [Aajonus]  Well, it depends how long you stay in there. Again, it's dry. You're going to create cracking on your skin. When you get into a bath where you have moisture in there and you have milk in the water, you have some vinegar and you have some sea salt, it's going to help you attract with a magnetic force of all those substances to help pull those toxins out of your skin.   So, your skin isn't going to have to work as hard. If you're in a sauna or a steam room, your skin gets damaged.

Soy Fed Chicken - Less Better

[Aajonus] Well, no. Rosie is a terrible chicken. Rocky Junior. Rosie feeds theirs 75% to 80% soy. Soy has to be cooked and processed. Raw soy will kill a human and will kill birds. So, they have to treat the soy before they feed it. So, it doesn't matter that the soybean was raised organically. Once it's treated with a solvent. It is a chemical. It is no longer organic. So, it is a lie, it's misrepresented. It's miss advertising. Rosie organic is not organic. Rocky Junior, the[Kathyy feed theirs 75-80% raw corn. The rest of it is soy, but I can't get them to stop feeding them soy. [Attendee] They're feeding them a certain amount of soy? [Aajonus] Soy, but it's a small amount compared to Rosie or any other chickens. Sheldon does the same thing. [Attendee] What about James' chicken, is that alright? [Aajonus] James gets Rocky. [Attendee] Why do they feed them soy? [Aajonus] Soy's an easy protein, fatten them up, build the muscle. [Kathy] It's not gonna bother you if you get that 20% in you? [Aajonus] Your body can handle it. If it's eating enough fat.

Stye - Use Lemon

Swordfish Aajonus Fav Fish

[Attendee] Swordfish is okay? [Aajonus] Yeah, it's still my favorite.

Third Worl Countries Parasites From Carbs

[Aajonus]  And there are some people who are in third world countries that live completely on cooked starches, and they don't get meat. So, what happens is they get parasites, and they have to help them eat that sugar decay, so it doesn't dissolve their whole body. Some people die of malnutrition. They're not dying of the parasite.  They're dying of malnutrition and the breakdown that the advanced glycation end products and acrylamides are causing in their body. But again, it's a food contamination, it's not the parasite or the bacteria causing the problem.  Flies do the same thing; flies secrete a fluid that dissolves matter. That's part of their digestion, it happens in the mouth, frogs do the same thing.  [Kathy]  If you eat something from a fly, it lands on the food, it may lay an egg- you may have an egg or something.  [Aajonus]  Even if it puts that fluid down, it's not going to hurt you. You're not eating enough.  It's not bacteria, we have 23,000 varieties of bacteria in our mouth. The human being is the most toxic and you're looking at bacteria. The most toxic salivary juices in the world. 2,300 various bacteria in the human mouth. How many people have you killed that you bit?  It's all bullshit. This whole bacteria thing is bullshit. The main enzyme we have is the Tylen enzyme and that breaks down sugar.  [Kathy]  It's the same thing if a dog bites you, you're not gonna get rabies?  [Aajonus]  Not likely.

Too Much Milk Causes Mineral Buildup

[Attendee] Um, I have been doing a lot of strength and health. And recently I met a dance teacher and I spent four days doing all these dances I've never done before. And my knees just became swollen, what causes that? [Aajonus] It's because you never got married. [Attendees] Laughs [Aajonus] No, what that usually is is toxic fats leaving your knees. [Attendees] So, I just overstimulated like a detox from all the dancing because I wasn't used to that kind of hopping. [Aajonus] Well, you also have to understand you were a big milk drinker. You didn't eat a lot of meat for the first three years on the diet. You mainly ate milk and didn't eat much meat and much butter. You were a milk drinker. Milk is highly concentrated in minerals, low in fat, not high enough in fat for the toxic as we are. So, you just kept collecting a lot of minerals with poisons. And when it comes out to the joints, it will cause tremendous swelling.

Too Much Vege Juice Lose Appeteite For Meat

If an adult drinks a lot of green juice and they lose their appetite for meat, they're drinking too much juice. Green vegetable juice.

Vegetable Oils Are Crystals

[2004] You take a raw vegetable oil and mix it with dirt and in a year it will be rock. You take animal fat and mix it with dirt, it'll mold and become earth. And it does that in the human body, hardens in the system. Amber is a rock from resin from a tree. Almost all your crystals are vegetable oils, vegetable fats. They don't break down in the system easily and once they've been cooking in the body, they never turn liquid until it reaches 102 degrees. So, you have to have lots of hot baths from a 102 to 105 degrees, and you have to stay in there for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.

Viruses Are Solvents

[2004]  [Aajonus]  Just remember, virus are not alive. This whole contagious shit about mosquitoes carrying virus, and all kinds of things. That's like you taking soap with you and saying that it's contagious. Soap is not contagious. It does not self-replicate, I don't care how many homes have tide in it. You cannot prove that it self-replicates.   The body makes solvent to dissolve compounds in your body. If you were so toxic that your body can't use a bacteria or a parasite or other live organisms to break that cell down that became tissue, your body has to make a soap, a solvent. That's what viruses are.  You look at any book, ask any good microbiologists, they'll tell you virus are protein bodies. They're not alive. They can't reproduce, but yet they self-replicate. Hello. They are soap, they are solvent. They even admit when you look in any biology book, you cannot find a virus outside of a live cell environment. Why? Because the cells are the producing the virus.  They don't self-replicate. A cell has to manufacture the soap. We manufacture soap all the time. We manufacture alcohol all the time. We'll take a carbohydrate and ferment it in our intestines, take the alcohol we'll make a solvent out of it. They'll dissolve the toxicity in the system. That's what a virus is. It's a refined, specific, highly densified protein body, solvent, that'll just dissolve matter.  It's not the nicest way to get rid of the toxins. The bacteria and parasites can consume decaying tissue and reduce it to a micro amount of what it was. It's like we can do 13 pounds of food in a day and pass a half a pound turd the next day. Well, if a parasite gets ahold of some tissue, it can reduce it to a hundredth of a percent of what it was and reduce that toxicity into a very small amount. So, it isn't so difficult to get rid of.   When the body uses a solvent, what happens when we use a solvent? we dilute it with water and then we contaminate everything else. And we have this whole bucket of contaminated water. It's the same thing happens in the human body.  We have virus, bacteria, and parasites to help us, detoxification is mitigated. When our body uses solvents, it's distributed a lot more toxic. That's why doctors are more afraid of viral meningitis than a bacterial meningitis, because the fluids become immense when we're scraping down all that toxic matter from the nervous system and mostly it's heavy metals, free radicals that go in and do tremendous damage to other areas of the body, which you don't normally destroy when parasites and bacteria are active.   [Attendee]  Talking parasite, are you talking a one cell parasite?  [Aajonus]  I'm talking about any parasite.   [Attendee]  Some of them can kill you?  [Aajonus]  No, they can't. You die from the treatment of amoebic dysentery, you take antibiotics, it destroys your ability to digest, and you die.

What To Drink At Night

[Aajonus] Drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice. You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, you go to sleep. [Attendee] What about in the middle of the night, take a milkshake too? [Aajonus] If you wake, yeah. If you don't wake, set an alarm after 5 hours. [Kathy] Or can just have plain milk, right? [Aajonus] You can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar. Milk by itself isn't good at that hour. [Lewis] What about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night. [Aajonus] Yeah, but that's not when you wake up after 5 hours.
[Kathy] You said you can have 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep, then you get up and haev another 4 ounces. Is that colostrum? [Aajonus] Colostrum is a little different from milk. it's very different from milk. [Kathy] So, colostrum you can have? [Aajonus] If you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night, you can have a glass of colostrum. Higher in fat and hormone, less in sugar. [Kathy] So then you'll have a four ounces of milkshakes one time and then have the other four ounces? [Aajonus] You could do that. [Kathy] But it makes it up to 4 ounces doesn't it? How many eggs should I put it? [Aajonus] It all depends, you know I've got the recipe in the recipe book. [Kathy] One egg? [Aajonus] No, you could have 1 to 3 eggs. 2 - 3 ounces of cream, and 3 - 5 ounces of milk, depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.

Whole Foods Feeds Their Cows Bakery Waste

Whole foods is worse. Whole food feeds theirs 15% bakery waste. Stale donuts, and they call it natural. "All natural".

(1) 90% Of Alfalfa Is Sprayed
[2004],[Attendee]

And now in Santa Fe all I can get is raw goat milk and they feed it grain

[Aajonus]

Cows, deer; they all eat lots of grain.

They eat grain all the time.

Grain fed animals are fine.

[Attendee]

I thought organic pastures fed them grass.

[Aajonus]

No, they feed them some grain?

Whenever they get milked, they get fed some grain.

[Attendee #2]

So, it's okay to give grain to them.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

They're built to eat that.

They're built to eat high carbs.

[Attendee]

I just thought my knees swelling might've been from all the sugar from the grains.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, well, it's high in minerals.

All milk is whether it's from a cow or goat, just from a goat there's even less fat than with a cow.

Yeah, but there's not enough fat to disperse and to get it out properly.

[Kathy]

How come you went to New Mexico.

Any reason?

[Aajonus]

Doesn't matter?

[Attendee #2]

85% percent of the time, the grain fed to animals is sprayed.

It's toxic grain.

[Aajonus]

We're talking about grain is fine, but you're talking about pesticides and stuff like that.

That's something different, but you have to understand that most of the grasses that are fed these animals too.

'cause they're fed alfalfa during the winter.

You know, bales of alfalfa, 90% of its's sprayed too.

Just like the grain.

[Attendee]

Even in New Zealand, in New Zealand.

[Aajonus]

No?

.

(2) Aajonus Can't Give Himself Parasites
I could never breed them

You know, I tried to spike myself with them and I couldn't get him to live.

After the chemotherapy, I was so poisoned that anything that tried to live in my body would die.

.

(3) Aajonus Eats Half A Pound Of Butter A Day
[2004]

Depends upon the individual

I eat a half a cup a day.

So half a pound a day minimum.

Plus my cream.

.

(4) Aajonus Likes The Taste Of Grain Fed Beef
(5) Acid Reflux From Poisons Dumping Into Stomach
That's usually severe delipidization

Means in your digested track and your sinuses, you may be dumping a lot of cauterized minerals from your days of cooked food.

So, they store in your esophagus and in your sinus and your stomach.

Well, when you eat.

No matter what you eat, the sinuses and the esophagus and the stomach will start dumping some of those into the food.

Acid reflux is that problem to the extreme.

So, it'll dump it into whatever food you have.

That's why I say you always need to eat fat with whatever food you're going to eat, so that those poisons don't go into the meat and the other nutrients because you won't be able to utilize them.

Once those portions get into there, they neutralize the acidity and the digested juices and destroy bacteria.

So, the villa don't work properly anymore, so that food will not be digested.

So, if you're eating butter, cream, eggs or something to fat with whatever food you're eating, so that fat will absorb those poisons so that you can utilize your food.

Otherwise, you will not.

You're not likely to to digest and utilize very much of it.

.

(6) Alzheimers Patients Forget To Drink Water
[Aajonus]

Do you have a question

[Attendee]

Uhh, yeah?

I had a talk with this guy.

He claims that people with Alzheimer's disease drink very little water and so in order to cure this problem, he put them on a 20 day fast and they drink about a gallon a day of water.

And he claims And he says talking to some of these people some of them haven't had a glass of water in 15 years.

Now I know you don't like too much water.

[Aajonus]

Well, in a situation like that, it's a temporary good fix because the water, like I said, is leaching.

You know, so they have a mineral buildup, if they a plaquing in their system that's blocking the neurological system, the lymph, or the circulatory system, the bloodstream.

Drinking a lot of water like that can cause a lot of dissolution of that plaque, those minerals.

But also what does it do to the blood in the glandular system and everything else.

So, they might be able to get away with doing it once or twice in their life, but not as a regular thing?

[Attendee]

Yeah, he's not doing this all the time.

Yeah, this this is a one time fix.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it's a one time fix, but it won't relieve it forever.

[Attendee]

Yeah, if they don't drink water, it may come back even.

[Aajonus]

Even if they drink while it'll come back.

But it is a temporary fix that can be utilized in certain situations.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

But the doctors don't have any solution

They don't have any solution to anything.

.

(7) Black Plague From Toxins, Coal Factories, Mercury
[Lewis]

Yeah, it runs the treatments that is that

[Aajonus]

It's from the high toxicity in the person and then when they take a drug or medication it weakens their body.

And they usually go in anaphylaxis, which is a shock.

And they die.

But of course the medical professionals isn't going to take blame for that.

Because then you'd sue them.

And they'd be blamed for everything that they do cause.

Try to do that with.

[Attendee]

So, if the person has rabies, that they just suffered the symptoms and never got an injection they could survive.

[Aajonus]

Correct.

But in the old days when they use to treat because you know you have foaming of the mouth because usually that particular bacteria is is familiar to the nervous system is like syphilis, so it can dissolve brain tissue quickly.

And if you've been a person who grew up, let's say.

A lot of people who got, you know lung disease, black lung disease were the people who lived in London around the smoking factories.

So, they got the black plague because they were around this heavy rlead and metal fog everyday breathing it, so lungs were heavily damaged.

So, it wasn't the bacteria that was associated with the detoxification.

There was the actual poison metals that were dissolving their lung tissue.

Of course, technology in those days you know you got silver, chalices and stuff like that.

It's supposed to be gorgeous and beautiful, full of mercury.

Got the smelting factories around and everybody thinks it's advanced society, you know, so you don't want to give it up.

You're not going to admit what it does.

[Attendee]

And the thing about historical stories that.

.

.

.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it didn't have anything to do with it.

Smoking factors and also when they were burning the cats, they were putting a lot of toxins in the air.

They were burning everything.

Jerusalem had it right.

You know in Jerusalem during Christ time; the garbage collectors were the pigs.

They were sacred.

You could not eat them.

You could not kill them; they'd run around the streets and- .

(8) Bloodshot Eyes From Sleeping
[2004],[Lewis]

Yes, I noticed I go into sleep about mid evening and that's fine

I know I'm detoxing and healing.

And afterwards when I wake up.

I notice a lot of redness, bloodshot in my eyes.

What is that.

[Aajonus]

That's usually the brain detoxifying heavy metals out your tear ducts?

[Lewis]

Right since I've had a history of metal.

.

(9) Brain Has Most Toxins In The Body
[Aajonus]

The toxins ago secrete out the eyes and the ears and the sinuses are all from the brain

And the brain has the most toxic collection of minerals than any other part of the body.

Your body needs metallic metals and other minerals to transfer light, which is neurotic transmission.

So, the brain collects a lot of heavy metals.

When they have to discharge, they discharge out the head, the throat, the gums.

All that heavy plaquing on your teeth.

Those are cauterized minerals, some cooked foods collected in the brain and they're discharging.

And there may be bacteria in it, they're may not.

Depending on how many cells are alive in your brain to be able to discharge some bacteria.

[Attendee]

Is there a remedy for that.

[Aajonus]

Is there a remedy?

Lots of cheese with butter to relieve the constipation?

Equal amounts of butter.

Yes, it is a cheesecake.

.

(10) Carpets
[Aajonus]

New carpets if you don't have cotton or wool carpets, you've got toxic plastic in your environments it's like wearing plastic clothes

Anything that isn't cotton, silk, or wool; you are going to breathe plastic particles, lint!

You take a synthetic, whether it's some pine needles or whatever.

You take the synthetic material, and you shake it in the light, you'll see all this plastic dust all over the place.

The lint is plastic.

Do you think that your lungs can break that plastic down.

No way!

So, your carpet?

You see that the carpet in my house, the synthetic is covered with either wool or cotton carpet every year.

[Kathy]

So, you can't vacuum it out.

You can't vacuum continually?

[Aajonus]

You'd have to vacuum 24 hours a day, all day long?

[Kathy]

It's not a carpet, it's a synthetic rug.

[Aajonus]

That is a plastic epoxy that gets into your lungs.

It's part of the fiber.

You cannot digest that.

We knowingly breathe plastic.

[Attendee]

Is it okay if we use a natural organic wool?

[Aajonus]

Well, if it's if it's from wool, period, if it's from an animal your body can break it down?

It's used to disassembling animal cells, whether it's hair or what.

Our bodies spent millions of years adapting to that, the plastic no.

[Attendee]

Linen.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but it will be a little bit more difficult because they use high heat to solidify it and the fats in vegetable oils harden in the human system?

It's harder to breakdown, it isn't as bad as plastic, but it's not as good.

Thank you.

.

(11) Causes and Remedies For Eye Problems
[Eric]

Eric, actually I had a real question and a quick novelty question that I think

The real one is what's your take on the causes and the remedies for the atheroma's that sometimes people develop under their eyes or in various places like that that.

Fat deposits.

[Aajonus]

Just remember that poisons storing the fats.

If your eyes, if your body is using your eyes as a detoxification center, the tear ducts.

Fatty deposits will normally form.

If they don't, you're in trouble.

Because the eyes will be terribly affected if they are, and you can see people with very bulging eyes.

And then all this sunken around them, they usually end up with a severe eye condition later in life, that's high pressure and like glaucoma, and cause a lot of problems, headaches continually throughout their life, irritability.

But anywhere where you have fat collections.

That is the body throwing poisons into those areas.

If it's around the eyes.

Like Laurie, when I first met her she had huge bags under her eyes.

She also cancer in three parts of her body, she was ultra thin.

Over the years it's diminished.

She doesn't have that bulging.

And her father had it too tremendously.

Now, usually the toxins that go secrete out the eyes.

And the ears- .

(12) Chlorine and Bromine In A Hot Tub
[Attendee]

What do you think about hot tubs

They probably have bromine and chlorine in them?

[Aajonus]

Well, my hot tub back there.

I just use sand in this filter.

I don't use any chemicals, just sand in the filter

Yep, I use a 200 pound sand filter.

I like my algae.

I breed the algae and make sure the algae is full in there.

It's beneficial to the skin.

And it helps feed the skin.

If the algae is eating the dead cells on the skin, then you don't need salmonella on the skin.

Salmonella dries me out too much.

But that's our normal cleanser.

Salmonella eats the dead cells on your skin to break them off and get rid of them.

So, salmonella is very important to have on the skin.

But if you live in an environment where you can have algae eat those dead cells instead of the salmonella, then your skin doesn't get as dry, or my skin doesn't get as dry.

Not right now, it's too hot.

I use it to get cool right now.

About 105 degrees.

Unless James gets in it, then it goes to 106-109.

No one can sit in it, but him.

laughs .

(13) Cholesterol Book
[Aajonus]

Good, you'll be healthier than most people

[Attendee]

I've been reading about that, but I feel absolutely the other way.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, just get rid of It, propaganda.

Like I said, get the book, it's called The Cholesterol Myth.

You read that book and you'll be cured.

Get that book and read it.

[Attendee #2]

I didn't hear the question.

[Aajonus]

She said she has high cholesterol levels, and she worries about the high cholesterol levels because when she eats the diet it makes a higher cholesterol.

Did you have a 700 cholesterol level.

I might be concerned?

That's a good amount.

I like 350 to 400.

[Attendee]

High cholesterol's healthy.

[Aajonus]

That's right?

You have to understand on this diet, even if you're not on this diet.

Still healthy to have a high cholesterol.

Because the fats bind with the poisons.

If you are fat deficient in your blood and you have a low fat level, guess where the poisons are going to go.

Into the cells?

The red and white blood cells, you're going to transfer less oxygen.

You're going to have more problems.

So, ahigh cholesterol level is good, it's just that the food industry like to jump on this thing about, well, we can sell now our foods calling them low cholesterol, like cereals and other garbage.

[Attendee #3]

What's the book called.

[Aajonus]

The Cholesterol Myth?

It's referenced in my recipe book.

OK, don't worry about be happy, because remember when you're on this diet, at least 50% of the cholesterols that are in your blood are going to be toxic ones that are on their way out.

.

(14) Citrus Oil
But it won't harm him

[Aajonus]   Oh, it could harm him, but it would healthfully harm him?

Yeah, but you know, usually in citrus oils, it's one of the most potent solvent oils.

You use it to make turpentine.

You know, so it's a very good solvent.

So, while he's young, he's probably breaking some very toxic oils down from.

Especially if he's eaten some cooked vegetables.

We'll break it down.

Mostly from citrus peel.

.

(15) Clothing Detergent Biokleen
No, I use biokleen from grape seed oil, grapefruit seed oil

.

(16) Cockroaches
[Aajonus]

But I never known

Anybody on this raw diet that had a roach problem.

I had a late summer.

[Kathy]

About roaches, what do you do about roaches.

[Aajonus]

Cause I never had a roach problem before?

Well, like I say, I been on this diet and even when I lived in Beverly Hills, they have the worst roach problem in the world they called Palmetto bugs in Beverly Hills.

Well, let me tell you, I was in a in a building where the roaches, I mean big big roaches with 90 year old woman that had an apartment above me and her place was- I mean 1 drawer I opened.

.

.

there were 1000 roaches in one drawer.

Under her sink there were at least 3000 roaches.

I had none in my apartment and my apartment was right next to her.

[Attendee]

Well, what do you think explains it.

The guy is not serial, they're outside of it, so?

[Aajonus]

They like cooked decaying food.

Cooked decaying food is what they live on.

[Attendee #2]

That's what she had all over her house.

[Aajonus]

Cooked, yeah?

Yep, they love that.

They love cereals, they love anything cooked.

[Attendee]

I heard if you leave a leaf on the floor, they'll be attracted, they'll smell that.

[Aajonus]

That's bullshit, that's bullshit?

They love mold.

[Attendee #2]

I used to have an apartment, I had roaches and I knew they didn't clean it properly.

I pulled the stove out and it was filthy and once I cleaned under that stove, I had no more roaches, but in Hawaii, the roaches were so big you could put saddles on them.

It's a really good way if you really have a lot of roaches is you just get empty jars and you put a little bit of oil.

Any kind of oil like here on the inside of the jar only at the top and then you put a little bit of stale beer in the bottom, and they go in after the beer, but then they can't climb out cause of the oil and then they just fill up the jars.

.

(17) Coconut Cream With Meat Or Fruit
If I want to, I usually don't have coconut cream with meat I usually save my coconut cream to have with fruit in the afternoon

.

(18) Cod Liver Oil Solvent Extracted
[Aajonus]

It's not raw

[Kathy],[Aajonus]

That Jacob Miller has cod liver oil

There's no cod liver oil that isn't solvent processed.

[Kathy]

You know I'm talking about.

Is that he has a listing of items.

[Aajonus]

I don't care, that cod liver oil is just as toxic as any other.

Cold pressed doesn't make any difference with solvent treated.

They purify it with a solvent.

.

(19) Cold Feet Takes 15 Years To Heal
[Attendee]

My feet tend to be cold

[Aajonus]

It's usually a bone marrow problem.

So, the bone marrow in your feet are probably pretty acid and pretty toxic.

So, that would be a matter of applying hot water bottles at night.

Get the circulation to change, and that usually takes 10 to 15 years change.

It's a long one, it's a long and slow one.

With me with my blood and bone cancer, the feet were the last thing to change and they did it in the last two years.

This particular ankle right here, the rest of my body could be completely warm, but this would feel like it came right out of the freezer.

And I would have to wrap it, bundle it.

[Kathy]

Now it's better.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, now this last two years is the first winter where I didn't have a problem?

It's fine, yeah.

[Kathy]

Can you wear socks.

You can't wear socks with it?

Yeah, you can wear socks?

Anytime you want.

[Attendee]

I'll tell you I bought these sandals 3 months ago and this is the first.

[Aajonus]

They're warming up.

It takes a long time.

[Attendee #2]

What about numbness in your feet.

If you move your toes and it feels kinda numb.

[Aajonus]

Dead cells.

Not enough fat to collect the toxicity, so it's gone into the nerves.

No cramping can be a mixture of a lot of different things.

Cramping can be dehydration.

It can be collection of toxic minerals, attractive substances too much carbohydrate byproducts, acrylamides that collect in the muscles.

.

(20) Cold Pressed Coconut Oil
[Attendee]

The organic cold pressed coconut

[Aajonus]

There's no such thing as unheated coconut.

They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, that's bullshit.

.

(21) Cows Dig Up Ground Eat Roots, Etc
Buffalo will pull up a whole field of potatoes if he gets ahold of one

Put it into a field of potatoes and the cow will dig it up.

That's why you put rings on the nose of pigs and cows.

.

(22) Cream Relievs Urehtra Pain
[Aajonus]

The nervous system detoxifies when there's no light and at night time

If you're in a climate you know like you're in, let's say, Finland.

In the summer, you know it's light all day long you will still detoxify.

Normally when the sun is the lowest.

And the nervous system detoxifies.

Like I said, in the nervous system, in the brain.

That has the most free radicals, heavy metals.

What happens if the free radicals touch cells, it burns them.

Gets into the blood, gets into the kidneys.

Gets into the bladder, causes irritation through the urethra into the bladder walls.

You have to relieve it, you have to get it out quickly.

Only way you can help resolve that is to drink a lot of cream before you go to sleep.

That will help ease it.

[Attendee]

I've been drinking my juice before bed.

[Aajonus]

Eliminate the juice and have let's say, like 2-3 ounces of cream with your juice.

[Attendee]

Well, not that much.

[Aajonus]

OK, then you gotta cut it out because the minerals and the juice are helping you eliminate from the neurological system at night.

If you're not sleeping well, it would be better that you didn't detoxify that quickly.

Cream is always good to help.

Bind with those acrid minerals that cause irritation to the tissue.

2-3 oz Yep, Yep.

If I drink a vegetable juice, I urinate 5 minutes later.

With.

.

.

intensity! Specially now that I'm so thin.

When I get the weight back on, it won't be as bad.

When you're as thin as me, you can't even move with that kind of mineral toxicity.

.

(23) Detoxing Old Sugar With Sugarcane Juice
[2004],[Aajonus]

OK, alright OK we're gonna get started now

Now first I'm gonna tell you the book that I've been working on next is detoxification.

And I get a lot of people from the Internet.

You know the Yahoo groups who talk about heavy detoxification and doing heavy detoxification.

So, my methods of detoxification are usually to take a food that you've eaten in the years of eating cooked foods.

You ferment it and eat it.

What you are doing is introducing bacteria that is absent in the food that you've eaten cooked.

So, you've got no way to recycle it out of the body.

So, your body has to make solvents like virus to dissolve that toxicity and remove it gradually, very gradually and slowly.

So, in the detoxification book, I'm telling people how to gradually detoxify.

And that's why I'm taking those foods, how to ferment them and how to eat them and in what quantities.

So, two weeks ago I decided to push the envelope to see how much of the detoxification was too much.

[Attendees],[Aajonus]

Laughs

I did it.

While I was in Vietnam three weeks ago, they have sugar cane juice.

You could get it anywhere, almost anywhere in Asia, and of course I was a sugar junkie.

I was diabetic and I would put down a whole box of chocolate covered cherries in one afternoon.

You know lots of candy and lots of powdered Donuts.

And I loved all that stuff.

I was a sugar freak.

Became diabetic.

So, I decided that I was going to detox the sugar that has been in my system.

So, I fermented the sugar cane juice.

Well, I had diarrhea for about 5 days on and off.

While I was in Vietnam, during that I got tremendous hives everywhere and I used to get hives all the time so badly that it burned my skin and it'd blister, and scabs would fall off.

And it was mainly around my kidneys, all the places where a diabetic is most effected.

So, it was all along here, I had huge marks still coming out my ass.

I lost mine complete ass, dropped in a week.

I had this beautiful round ass, and it was gone in a week.

But sugar was stored in these tissues.

It's not there! No ass!

Second thing to do, I was also a heavy milk drinker, pasteurized milk drinker.

So, two weeks ago I decided to drink an intense amount of fermented milk.

That was two weeks fermented, so it smelled like alcohol.

It burned my lungs if I inhaled it.

So, I drank 2 ½ cups of it at one time.

I was on the toilet for three days, 72 hours.

[Attendee]

Is that raw milk.

[Aajonus]

Raw milk?

And again, it caused that kind of detoxification, but that wasn't my ass, lost my ass.

I also lost about 20 pounds in about four days.

So, I put 10 pounds back on, so I don't look so bad as I did four days ago, but he kicked my butt, so I kind of see the limitation.

So, all these people on the Internet who say go for it.

Heavy detoxifications, I don't suggest to do.

Not unless you're 50 pounds overweight.

You can afford to lose that much weight.

It was too much for me to lose, I was debilitated.

I could barely move for about two or five days.

You know, just diarrhea and the exhaustion and the weight loss.

And getting back up to this weight, I've been eating all day long every day.

Food and food and food and food and cheesecakes galore.

And cheesecakes help absorb that toxicity.

I had less rashes, less hives when I would eat the cheesecake, so I'd make a cheesecake for about 3 days.

And eat pieces all along the day throughout the day.

So, that's what I have to say about the detoxification before the book comes out.

Don't push anything too heavily.

You're going to ferment something to detoxify that that's in your body, something you've eaten a lot of in your past life, cooked life.

No more than an ounce or two ounce every time with that particular food.

Don't push it.

Unless, you know you've got a lot of weight.

You know, then you could probably afford to do it, but still, if you have to work, you're not going to be able to function very well.

If you have that kind of a detoxification, OK, any questions about that.

[Jeff]

Even if you eat something from your past, is it necessarily pulling out the old stuff?

[Aajonus]

Well, what I did was I had some of my feces checked while I was in Vietnam?

I got a laboratory to check it and it was a lot of old toxic cauterized sugar in there from that.

And here it was metals.

When I had the milk, it caused a bunch of metals to come out of my system.

And I started forming stones in my urine.

You know, so it caused a heavy mineral detoxification.

.

(24) Detoxing Through Skin, Dry Skin Etc
[Attendee]

Tell us a bit about it because detoxing through the skin

Can it cause symptoms like dry skin, itchy skin, chapped lips and warts.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

That's why I like the primal facial body care cream.

If you're going through any kind of a skin detox, any kind of a rash, dry skin period.

Poisons are leaving through your skin.

In an intense amount it's drying out the surrounding cells.

There's not enough fat in those cells, so when the toxin moves past it, it draws the fat outt of that cell and that cell will crack and damage and scar.

So, with the primal facial body care cream on.

It will be able to be absorbed into the surrounding cells.

So, you don't have as much damage.

I mean, if I hadn't put that on these areas, I would have huge sores and huge scars.

[Kathy]

You make it up.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, you make it up, it's on page 145 of the recipe book?

[Attendee #2]

How long is it good for.

[Aajonus]

I've had it up to six months in the refrigerator?

[Attendee #2]

Throw it away after.

[Aajonus]

No, I've always used it within six months?

.

(25) Diet For Over Acidic Gums
[Attendee]

And what about the gums and stuff

[Aajonus]

Gums, you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system, going out the teeth?

So keep honey and butter in your mouth.

You absorb those acids.

Or cream, keep a little bit of cream in your mouth.

Honey/butter mixture.

It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth.

.

(26) Different Meat Sdifferent Bacteria
[Kathy]

Then why are you going into different meats to make high chicken, high beef, all these other things

[Aajonus]

Because there's a different bacteria for each meat, there are thousands of bacteria, which you want to try to get them all going.

[Kathy]

High fish will help you digest fish, right.

[Aajonus]

Yes, correct?

There's a whole array of bacteria for each meat.

And if you breed those and introduce those to your body, you're going to digest that.

.

(27) Don't Drink Vege Juice At Night
[Attendee]

Can you say you prefer the green juice before you go to bed

[Aajonus]

It all depends upon the individual?

I give guidelines in the book, four juices a day, one before you go to sleep at night.

If you're a person who gets hyperactive from drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice.

You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, and go to sleep.

[Attendee #2]

In the middle of the night, take a milkshake.

[Aajonus]

If you wake.

Yeah.

.

(28) Don't Go Longer Than 5 Hours Without Eating
(29) Don't Sit In Sun With Dry Skin
[Aajonus]

Well, if your skin is dry, you don't want to sit in the sun without the Primal Facial Body Care Cream or coconut cream

[Attendee]

What about coconut oil.

[Aajonus]

If it's raw coconut oil that you make yourself, it's great?

That's what the natives always used for thousands and thousands of years, just break coconut juice.

They would grate the coconut meat and ring out the fat, apply it and eat it.

[Kathy]

The organic cold pressed coconut.

[Aajonus]

There's no such thing as unheated coconut.

They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, bullshit, not raw.

.

(30) H Pylori
[2004],[Aajonus]

H

Pylori is part of the stomach lining, we've had it for billions of years, all animals.

Again, the medical profession is trying to blame everything that's disease on bacteria, but we lived with these bacteria for millions of years without disease.

Why is everybody getting ulcers now.

Ulcers were unheard of before coffee became into existence.

Now that coffees around, ulcers are normal thing.

And again, if you have an ulcer, you're going to have pylori bacteria in the tissue, but that didn't cause the problem, whatever poisoned the stomach lining created the ulcer.

[Attendee]

What do you do.

How do you get rid of the flatulence, the indigestion or whatever?

[Aajonus]

That's what I mean, my detoxification book is going to get into foods that are fermented, they can start breaking these things down, Yeah?

That's what my book is going to go into hopefully without killing anybody.

[Kathy]

Raw sauerkraut.

[Aajonus]

Again, I'm not going to give any specifics on any of that until I finish all my work and research, because for some people, it's sauerkraut, particular person a particular amount?

So, you don't want to dive into this unless you know what you're doing.

Um, you get one question first and then we get around.

Yeah.

.

(31) High Fish Neurological Detox
[Aajonus]

When I experimented with high fish in stages, eating too much at one time, it can cause a heavy neurological detoxification

It is rare, but it could happen, and it happened to me.

It caused a meningitis.

It crippled me for about five days, but I'm not your average guy, I'm sickly.

[Attendee]

Was it bacterial or viral.

[Aajonus]

Bacterial?

Let me repeat it.

Bacteria in high meat is for digesting meat.

It's not for detoxifying the system.

.

(32) Honey Breaks Down Protein and Per Day
[Attendee]

And put it on there and it almost liquifies it

[Aajonus]

Dissolves it.

That's why I say, if you're going to eat honey, you need a certain amount of protein in a day.

Like in the recipe book, because people were eating too much honey and not eating the meat and they were getting protein deficient.

So, that's why I say you could have six tablespoons of honey a day.

If you're eating a pound of meat, if you're not eating a pound of meat, you have to reduce it proportionally the amount of honey that you consume.

[Kathy]

You can't just have a tablespoon of honey in the morning.

[Aajonus]

It's not a good idea?

It's always good to have it with food, not by itself.

No, you don't have to have that much, honey.

It's up to you.

It's up to your digestion.

If you're digesting fine, you don't need a lot of honey, but if everything's very slow digesting, you should be having honey throughout the day.

[Attendee]

Is that all the honey does.

Help digestion, does it have any other benefits?

[Aajonus]

That's just about it, digestion.

That's why the bears love it.

The bears can digest so much food, so quickly.

They can gain a tremendous amount of weight.

And if they're not gaining the weight, you can better believe they're going to go into a hive, they will invade a hive.

If a bear is having trouble gaining weight, he knows he's not going to make it through hibernation.

So, he will go in and suffer all the stings in the eyes he can take to eat that honey, so he can digest all the foods.

[Attendee]

Because he hibernates, that's why another animal wouldn't necessarily do that.

[Kathy]

But you can't just have a lick of the honey with some lemon juice.

[Aajonus]

It's not a good idea to have stuff like that.

Damaging the teeth and the system.

If you're gonna dilute it, dilute it in some water.

Yeah.

You know the lemonade, the lemon, the honey, the water and the cream together.

[Kathy]

Oh, the water on the mineral water.

Yeah.

[Attendee]

With honey, you are consuming a lot of raw honey.

You should always consume a little more raw protein right.

[Aajonus]

Exactly, that's what I'm saying?

[Attendee #2]

What's honey made of.

[Aajonus]

Honey is nectar, nectar from a flower, pussy juice?

.

(33) Honey Per Day Aajonus
[Aajonus]

I eat my six tablespoons a day, if I eat a pound of meat

If I eat more than a pound of meat, I can eat up to proportionally, whatever I could eat up to a cup a day if I have three pounds of meat a day, by the way.

[Attendee],[unclear size],[Aajonus]

By the way Aajonus, I ordered two of raw Tupelo

Oh yeah, it's hard to get unheated though.

[Attendee]

Totally unheated, raw.

[Aajonus]

Tupelo is so thick.

[Attendee]

Yeah, I Understand.

This 90 year old man has been doing it for a long time and it's totally raw.

[Aajonus]

Tupelo is highest because there's a particular nutrient in the Tupelo flower, in the nectar that even allows the bees to produce more insulin.

So, it is even easier for diabetics to eat, it's a slower metabolized.

It's slower and metabolized.

[Kathy]

So, if you're eating meat, have a tablespoon of honey every time.

[Aajonus]

⁠ I do definitely?

I always have honey with my meat.

.

(34) Honey With Butter Doesn't Count To Honey Limit
[Aajonus],[Attendee]

That's if you're having the honey and butter mixture after an egg

The moisturizing formula is not enough honey, that's all I had

[Aajonus]

The honey and the butter doesn't count?

It doesn't count.

[Kathy]

It doesn't count your honey and your meat.

[Aajonus]

No, because it's mixed in with the butter?

The formula it's already attached to that medium.

[Kathy]

So, you need an additional tablespoon with each meat meal.

[Aajonus]

Correct?

.

(35) Hot Bath Ingredients
[2004],[Aajonus]

Uh, usually I suggest -two to three cups of milk per bath -two tablespoons of sun dried sea salt -two to four tablespoons of raw, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar

Those will help magnetize the poisons in your connective tissue and in your lymph, out through your skin.

[Kathy]

Why is that 2-4.

[Aajonus]

It depends on how toxic your water is?

[Kathy]

So, generally in LA it should be more toxic.

[Aajonus]

if you're in the valley, it's less toxic than LA note?

Milk, salt and vinegar, 2-4 tablespoons.

.

(36) How Long After Meat To Eat Honey
As soon as I finished with the meat, I can have the honey

I may wait, but I usually have it immediately.

.

(37) How Long To Regenerate Body Parts
[2004],[Aajonus]

No

And it's from when I started welting up, the toxins started moving out through my skin, a little bit too much.

Sugar stays in your body three years at four, I said, it takes 40 years to clean out every cell in your body.

Five times, it takes five times.

According to Pottengers and Howells work.

Takes five generations to clean the body out.

Your blood takes 40 days.

The skintakes two and a half years.

Testes take two and a half years.

The bones take seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell.

You have to do that five times.

Every cell in your body has to be replaced at least five times to get to the point where you're completely whole, whole, and natural and healthy.

[Attendee]

You mean you're not replacing them with good cells yet.

[Aajonus]

You take somebody who's not well, and when they reproduce, their offspring will not be so healthy?

They'll have toxins built into it.

Right.

So, it takes 40 years for humans to go through that cycle, 40 years.

In Howell and Pottenger's work, what they did was, as soon as the cat or rat reproduced, and the next offering was going, they would kill that animal and then perform autopsies and do tests on it to see the changes.

And it took five generations.

Well, we don't have to wait five generations of our offspring.

We have to wait five generations and cellular transition.

It's about 40 years.

And that's if you're 100%, if you're not 100%, it could take a lifetime, you know, 50, 60, 80 years, all depends.

And that all depends upon how healthy you want to be.

I'm one of those who never wants to have another day of my own purposeful lack of energy and illness.

I just don't want to have that.

I want to see how healthy I can get and I'm only 21 years into my 40 years.

So, I'm only halfway and I'm already satisfied.

Even after I got my butt kicked, I still made it I'm here.

.

(38) How Much Meat Can A Child Eat (x)
(39) How To Get Rid Of Heavy Metals
Well, there are different things I recommend

-Coconut cream -Cilantro -Dark Berries .

(40) Ionizers Leave Room
[Aajonus]

Yeah, but just make sure they're not on while you're in the room

[Attendee]

Is there any other particular equipment you might like.

[Aajonus]

Your Alpine equipment is pretty good?

[Attendee #2]

How about a fan.

[Aajonus]

Make sure it's three feet from you because the EMF field?

Just make sure you're not in the room when they're on.

Because they will change the atomic structure of the air and it's not conducive to health.

It burns nerve tissue.

.

(41) LA Water
There's no way, unless you're, going to put those ingredients in water, then your body can't reabsorb it, but not like, even if you don't have those things in it, you're not likely to reabsorb what you've exhibited, but you're likely to absorb the chemicals are in the water

If I get into LA city water, without those ingredients, I cannot stay in there longer than 7 minutes and I got to get out of there like I'd had 10 cups of coffee and I mean, I am buzzing, my heart's going 90 miles an hour and I'm just shaking.

So, I can't do that.

Here I've got my own well, so I don't' have all that problem.

.

(42) Lymph System - Lymph Massage
[Aajonus]

To get that stuff liquid again

So, you can get it moving out of the lymph system.

Because the lymph system is responsible for cleaning the body.

And if the lymph system isn't moving, our arteries, heart congestion is going to keep collecting.

[Attendee]

Would lymph massage help.

[Aajonus]

No, lymph massage is the worst thing you can do?

Lymph massage is a deep tissue massage.

They go down, crack your veins in your circulatory system, your nerves and your lymph system.

Rolfing is the worst, but any kind of deep tissue massage that isn't gradual.

If they're going to go deep, they have to start lightly and move in slowly.

So, they're not ripping and breaking things.

I suggest that you do just the tickle therapy.

If you take your hand and you go over your hair, you'll get a tingling, do it to each other.

So over here, hair, on your arm said, hope tingled goes through your entire body.

What more stimulation could you want that.

When I have a massage, that's what I have them do?

I have him do my entire body tickle therapy.

You barely touch my skin.

You just go over like that entire body.

And it generates everything.

The therapist when they're finished with me, they're more red than I am because they're getting all this energy from me as well.

.

(43) Make Up For Sleep By Sleeping More
She asked if you haven't been getting enough sleep

Can you make it up by sleeping more.

Yes, you can, just remember that 90% of cellular division happens in the sleep state?

So healing, 90% of the healing happens in the sleep.

After I got my but kicked on this, I was sleeping 10, 12 hours a day.

It was me, you know, I'm usually four and a half hours a day, person, five hours a day, maximum sleeping.

[Kathy]

Did you get up at a time and eat food.

[Aajonus]

Oh yes?

I never slept more than three hours at a time.

Four hours.

Always like, of course I don't have to set an alarm.

I got my own internal alarm.

.

(44) Milk Alone High In Sugar
[Kathy]

Or you can just have plain milk, right

[Aajonus]

You can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar?

Milk by itself isn't good at that hour It's high in sugar.

[Lewis]

What about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but that's at night?

That's not when you're waking up after 5 hours.

[Kathy]

He said 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep and when you get up and have another 4 ounces, that's colostrum, is that like milk.

[Aajonus]

Colostrum is a little different than milk?

It's very different from milk.

If you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night you can have a glass of colostrum.

Higher in fat and hormones, less sugar.

.

(45) Milkshake Recipe
[Kathy]

How many eggs do you have to make

[Aajonus]

It all depends on me?

You know, I got the recipe in the recipe book.

-1 to 3 eggs

2 to 3 ounces of cream
3 to 5 ounces of milk Depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.
.

(46) Monsanto Trying To Destroy Animals
[2004],[Aajonus]

E

coli 157 is a fiction.

Monsanto's trying to destroy all the animals in the world, so that any animal that you will get, they will have genetically engineered and patented.

That way, if ever you have an animal that you raised, you have to pay them royalties.

That is the whole idea.

.

(47) Mother Not Producing Milk
[Attendee]

The lady who showed us to have her baby in a hospital

And the doctor decided very quickly and with labor, she now has the baby and wants to nurse the baby.

She is not producing enough.

Now they're having a formula, any suggestions.

[Aajonus]

Lots of milk and eggs, milk, raw milk, a little bit of honey, a lot of cream?

Oh yeah.

This formula is very toxic.

Mostly made with soy.

Yeah, it works.

If the mother is also getting enough other protein from eggs or meat, otherwise it doesn't work.

I mean it will help them build porosity, but it doesn't help them build a good fat.

She asked how many eggs a day I eat, anywhere from four to 20.

[Attendee]

You were talking about the baby formula, I wasn't breast fed.

[Aajonus]

So, that's the problem.

[Attendees],[Attendee]

Laughs

And I was told by my doctor that I was a very fat baby.

[Aajonus]

Congratulations, a wonderful thing.

A fat baby is a very protected baby, a skinny baby is one where the brain will be damage by any toxins that enter the body.

I like fat babies, I like fat people.

.

(48) Mucus Discharges Poisons
Depends on what's causing it

I mean if it's heavy metals coming out through your mucous membranes, you're not going to stop it.

All you can do is just produce enough mucus to keep it from being problem.

And that means eating lots of eggs with dairy to create enough mucus to protect your mucous membrane.

But I can see by the whites of your eyes, that you have a lot of toxicity in your bone marrow, that means you have a lot of heavy metals in your bone marrow, and that's going to create a problem in any of these bones right here, you're going to detox out of your sinuses.

So, you're going to have an allergy problem all your life, until all that's relieved.

So, the only thing you can do is make sure that you produce enough mucus to protect those mucus membrane and to discharge the poisons.

.

(49) Need To Gain Weight - Over Acidity
[Attendee]

I have this acid reflux that causes this cough continually after I eat, when I lay down at night

My teeth, my gums are bleeding continually.

[Aajonus]

You're way too thin.

You don't have any fat to bind with anything.

So, all these acids are getting into your blood, into your lymph and to your neurological system.

They're burning your system.

You have to get fat in a condition like that.

[Attendee]

I'm eating lots, I've been on it 16 months.

[Aajonus]

Not enough.

I mean, you should be 30 pounds heavier with that kind of condition.

[Attendee]

I put on 60-70 pounds.

I took off 10 of that already.

I mean, I didn't try.

[Aajonus]

I'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition, like that, it permeates their system, unless there is that excessive fat in the blood, lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be saved.

You're always going to have symptoms.

.

(50) Nervous System Detoxes At Night
(51) No Fruit Afte 6 In Afternoon
[2004]

I tell people to eat their fruit in the afternoon and not after six, seven o'clock

Cause it could disturb the whole system after.

.

(52) No Green Juices After 6PM
(53) No Honey After High Meat
[2004],[Kathy]

Even after high meat, you can have the honey with your mate 20 minutes later

[Aajonus]

If I'm having high meat, I wait 15 minutes before I eat my regular meat meal.

I have my high meat, wait 15 minutes to have my regular meat meal and then wait until I finish the meat meal before I have my honey.

.

(54) No Milk&Honey&Butter With High Meat
[2004],[Aajonus]

That's why I say, you don't have a honey with high meat

You don't have milk with high meat either, the lactic acid in the milk will destroy the bacteria.

[Attendee]

Can you drink it down with water.

[Aajonus]

I don't drink it down with anything, but you can with water if you're going to do anything use water?

I just chew it and down it.

Yeah, then I'll rinse my mouth out if I don't like the taste, but I like the taste.

I like it.

It's not a problem, but never take butter with high meat .

(55) No Vegetable Juice For Children
[2004],[Aajonus]

Uh, because children have a lot of HGA, which is human growth hormone

You know, when we reached 21, 25, we stop producing it.

If we don't eat raw meat, we're never going to manufacture it again.

We eat raw meat than we will, and we will still continue to have growth hormones.

But children, even if they don't eat meat, they have growth hormones, 99% of them.

What that causes is an alkaline condition in there blood.

So, if they drink the vegetable juice, they become too over alkaline, then they become repulsed to meat and even to dairy, and then they won't eat those foods and then they get cranky.

They start going for sugars and then it's unruly and unmanageable.

And then it's when you don't want to have children laughs.

So, you don't want them to have vegetable juice, but maybe one day a week.

And then you can usually tell they get a little red around the mouth and they're getting a little acidic, a little red around the eyes, red around the ears, they're getting over acid, but it only takes one cup and their back, even a half a cup for a child that size.

So, you need to use much parsley and children's juice should be only maybe 5% parsley and 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.

The parsley causes them to get really alkaline, overly alkaline in their intestines and blood.

That's the most alkalinizing besides concrete.

So, it has to be minimized.

[Attendee]

You say they tend to lose their appetite when they become over alkaline.

[Aajonus]

Yes , when your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline, you lose appetite for meat?

You just start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars.

[Attendee]

If you had the juice and you don't have an appetite after the juice, it could that you are over alkaline.

[Aajonus]

Too much for you?

Then you shouldn't be drinking that much juice, or you should skip that particular juice at that time of day.

.

(56) Over Alkalinity - No Craving For Meat
[Aajonus]

Over alkaline, yes

When your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline you lose your appetite for meat.

You start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars.

[Attendee]

So, if you have the juice and don't have any appetite after the juice it could be that your are becoming over alkaline.

[Aajonus]

Too much for you, you shouldn't be drinking that much juice or you should skip that particular juice at the time of day?

.

(57) Overacidity & Slant Bed Upwards
[2004],[Aajonus]

I'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition like that, it permeates their system, unless there's that excessive fat in the blood lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be safe

You're always going to have symptoms.

And if you sleep, you better sleep at a slant.

[Attendee]

I tried that.

[Aajonus]

Well, it keeps the lungs from collapsing, if you're lying straight the acids seep into the lungs.

The lungs can collapse and be hard to breathe properly.

When you've got it at a slant, you don't have the gravitational weight as a hindrance to breathing.

You're elevated like this, feet are this way, the legs are this way and the bodies at an angle.

[Attendee]

I tried that didn't do any good, lifted the head in my bed.

[Aajonus]

But you had your feet down this way.

[Attendee]

No, I lifted just the head of the bed.

[Aajonus]

How can you lift just the head.

If you're lifting the head of the bed, the whole bed is gonna crank?

[Attendee]

There were bricks underneath it.

[Aajonus]

Here's the bed, you put bricks under here, the whole beds gonna slant upward.

What you have to do is you have to get the bed like a hospital bed, this level where you're from the waist up at a high angle what you can do is get one of those rectangular shaped pillows or put on your body or use three pillows to layer it.

So, you're at that angle.

[Attendee]

And what about the gums and stuff.

[Aajonus]

I say you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system going out the teeth?

So, keep honey and butter in your mouth.

You absorb those acids or cream to keep a little bit of cream in your mouth.

Honey & butter mixture.

It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth acid.

What acid fruit are you talking about tomato.

Grapefruit is fine?

It all depends upon the individual.

I tell people to their their fruit in the afternoon and not after 6-7 o'clock because it could interrupt the whole system.

.

(58) Parasites, Tapeworms
[Aajonus]

A tapeworm lives in the intestines on high carbs

So, as long as you're discarding high-carbohydrate waste into your intestine.

Those are going to be your friends.

The tapeworm only lives in a third world environment where there's only grains.

[Kathy]

Somebody said that when they got the monkfish livers that they found worms in it.

They would find worms in the monkfish or red snapper.

[Aajonus]

Those are not tapeworms, we're talking about a tapeworm.

[Attendee]

But my one was like, it was like a round worm.

.

[Aajonus]

Pinworm, that lives on the intestinal walls.

It lives in the intestinal walls like it does in the tripe of the chicken and what they are eating is toxic protein.

[Attendee]

Why does my one come out.

[Aajonus]

It probably got too toxic?

[Attendee]

Maybe because of the raw diet.

[Aajonus]

No?

It's like I say, lives on your intestinal walls.

It doesn't have anything to do with what you're eating.

Tapeworm lives on what you're eating, pinworm lives on your intestinal walls because of the toxicity.

You need to have them.

If you don't have the pinworm, your intestines could go into cancer.

[Attendee]

So, there's no danger from them going to organs and things like that.

[Aajonus]

If you ate just cooked carbohydrates your entire life, possible?

Infiltrates the tissue, or if you got poisoned by something that would completely destroy the integrity of cellular divisions it could.

But that would take a mass poisoning right there.

Say a fish gets into an area with high mercury contamination or high radioactivity.

.

.

.

(59) Parsely Too Alkaline For Children
So, you don't need to use much parsley in children's juice

Should be only maybe 5% parsley and, you know, 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.

The parsley causes them to get really alkaline.

Overly alkaline in the intestine and blood, that's the most alkalizing thing beside concrete, so it has to be minimized.

.

(60) Pasteurized Milk & Osteoporosis
[Aajonus]

You have to understand that pasteurized milk causes a lot of osteoporosis and a lot of hardening of the bone

A lot of people get broken bones from eating pasteurized dairy because of the minerals that are cauterized.

So concentrated in minerals that it collects in the system.

When I had the fermented milk, it started clearing out of my tissues.

A lot of those cauterized minerals.

[Attendee]

What would you use to detox old grains and breads.

[Aajonus]

You just take those grains?

If you were eating rye bread, then you use rye.

And you let them soak in a lot of water for about three days till they start fermenting and getting mold on them.

Then you eat just a little bit of it, but you don't do a lot unless you want to go through a heavy detoxification.

So I don't know how much I'm scarred.

I still have, you know, the sore, you see the spots.

You know, the little sore from where the hives came out and blistered my skin, see the dark spots.

Uh, I've got them all over here and some on my chest.

[Kathy]

Like black spots.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, little dark spots?

See them.

.

(61) Peppermint Oil For Termites
[2004],[Attendee]

Fumigating sounds bad, probably is bad

How do I get rid of these guys without having them destroy.

.

.

[Aajonus]   All you have to do is get some mint juice.

Get some mint, like I grew up peppermint all around here, juice that and just start spraying it all around and it will soak into the wood and they cannot eat it now.

[Attendee]   Are they going to go somewhere else now er.

[Aajonus]   They'll go somewhere?

Oh, kill them.

[Attendee]   Those are in there under the home because all I have remnants of is our waste, they built pinholes and they push the waste out.

Inject down those holes or.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, get some mint juice and just start pouring it all around?

[Attendee #2]   Does actually growing the plant help.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, it does help?

It will also keep ants away; ants will not burrow into ground where mint is growing.

[Attendee #2]   How long does it last.

[Aajonus]   If it soaks into the wood, it's forever?

Especially if it has worm holes already in it.

[Attendee]   Boric acid powders.

[Aajonus]   Well, boric acid powders and if you breathe it, it can cause deteriorations of your respiratory system,  Yeah, but also it gases though, say if it rains and moisture gets into the framework, it gases, and you have to deal with those vapors?

These things were known naturally ages ago, they had fields of mint and they would just grind it into a liquid and just start dumping, treating the wood that way before it even got into a house.

[Attendee #3]   Oh, so they would build houses with mint treated wood.

[Aajonus]   Oh yeah?

Egyptians were heavy with that when they didn't use rock, they preferred rock.

But when they used wood, they were always mint treating.

[Attendee #4]   Using baking soda as a deodorant.

[Aajonus]   No, no, terrible! Diluted lemon juice is the best thing for that?

.

(62) Places With Good Air Quality
[Attendee]

Is there a way to kind of more on a localized basis to monitor air quality

In other words, I'm kind of looking for another place to live, but I want to pick some place where the air is better.

You know what I mean.

[Aajonus]

Can't get better than this area and the further you go into the city, the more toxic you get?

[Attendee]

What about like Altadena, higher up.

Are they better or not?

[Aajonus]

Terrible! There's a whole toxic layer that sits up there, right up on the mountain, halfway up the mountain?

And that layer is probably 1500 feet thick.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

Wow, cause I was at the impression-

if you ever go up in a small plane and you look at the layers, you'll see.

[Attendee #2]

Best area you said.

[Aajonus]

Anywhere along the beach?

[Attendee]

Are there any like parts or anything, where do they actually do give you like a more specific report on the air.

[Aajonus]

They won't do that?

Everybody would be discouraged.

[Attendee]

Yeah.

Then how do you know.

[Aajonus]

I used to do some tests?

I took flight lessons.

I saw the layers.

.

(63) Poisons Collect In Fat & Organs
[Lewis],[Aajonus]

One time I thought I heard you say that poisons and hormones collect primarily in the organs of the animals-

Correct, in the fat, and the organs

[Lewis]

Okay.

So, uh, just how bad is the muscle.

[Aajonus]

It's not bad, most of the poisons go to the fat and the glands.

That's why I won't eat glands from an animal, unless it's an organic animal.

.

(64) Purpose Of High Meat - Digest Meat
[Kathy]

Uh, when you're making high fish, what will the high fish do for you

What will it help?

[Aajonus]

Okay?

Anytime you are making high meat, the whole purpose is for bacteria to break down the meat.

Normally in our digestive tracts we have a lot of bacteria that breaks down meat.

Not only hydrochloric acid, but bacteria, salmonella, E.

coli.

E.

coli is the last final digestion of meat.

And then E.

coli is the most important bacteria there is.

It helps you synthesize B-vitamins and amino acids.

It takes that protein and breaks it down into the finest form.

It's a backup for your immune system.

When you take meat and you fill it full of bacteria, whether you're coating it with E.

coli the E.

coli breeds on it, what you are doing is introducing bacteria into your body that will help you digest meat, period.

That's what it's for.

If you want to go into detoxification, you have to ferment that meat severely.

You have to let it go into a liquid where all the protein is already predigested by the bacteria and it's high in alcohol.

That's a bacteria detoxification and that is an extremely hard point to get to.

You have to let your meat sit for 6, 7, 8, 10 months before we will come become completely liquid like that.

Bacteria in high meat is to help you to just meat, period.

That is what it's for.

.

(65) Raw Honey & Babies
[Aajonus]

That's all, cause they don't know any better

⁠When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it produces an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carb into enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly protein.

So, it has the protein for digesting protein.

It's like a solvent that helps break down cellular structures of meat and eggs.

Anything that's high in protein.

Once you heat it above 93 degrees, that is neutralized or destroyed, the hotter it gets the more destroyed.

[Attendee]

What degrees.

[Aajonus]

93 degrees?

See the bees fan the hive and keep it at 92.

If the top of the hive goes above 92.

8 for very long, for an hour and a half, they will abandon it.

They will go to a lower area and they will never eat that honey, unless they're starving.

[James]

I was real skeptical, I deal with Honey Pacifica and Aajonus, I went to the hive desert with him, I stuck my hand in the hive.

It was 109 degrees out, but the hive was 75.

And many times we've watched the bees not to be able to keep the hive below 93 degrees, they're gone.

So this is exactly right.

[Aajonus]

So, what happens is if the baby has a concentrated sugar without the insulin- See when the bees get back to the hive they vomit.

So, honey is nectar predigested vomit.

That's what honey is.

Once it's heated, that insulin substance is neutralized.

So, when it gets into the baby's system, it's too much sugar.

It gets into the blood and nervous system and it can cause anaphylaxis just like a drug.

And let me tell you most honeys are treated.

They are filtered with a filter that has high chemical reactions in it.

They're also subjected to cleansers.

And then if the baby gets that poison, you go into an anaphylaxis shock.

Unheated honey never has caused a problem and I had babies a month old.

[James]

Okay.

The next thing to know is that there is no law.

There is no legal description of what the word raw means, That includes cheese, honey, oil, cold pressed, and so if you go to a honey or a beekeeper.

[Aajonus]

They'll tell you it's raw because they believe it's raw.

[James]

Then when you go and check out their operation, it's heated to 120 degrees in the jar.

They still don't believe that is heating.

They believe it's warming.

[Attendee #2]

Cold pressed.

[Aajonus]

Cold spun?

[Attendee #2]

Is it okay to mix raw honey in a meat dish.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

[James]

Sometimes I got piece of tough meat or tough fat and I'll put a piece of honey on it and it almost dissolves it.

.

(66) Sauna Too Hot
[Aajonus]   I like the idea of heat, but saunas I do not like, they're too hot

By the time they get through the third layer of skin, they damage the enzyme content in the skin and the vitamin content, and then start affecting the connective tissue.

They also burn the mucous membrane.

Steam is the same thing; it can even be worse because that gets into the lungs.

Because in the sauna you can clear the air by the time it gets past the bronchial, but with steam it will actually get into the lungs and damage the lung walls.

So, hot baths, hot water bottles.

That is what you should use to help yourself perspire to get rid of the poisons.

[Attendee]   What about setting the sauna at low temperatures.

[Aajonus]   Well, it depends how long you stay in there?

Again, it's dry.

You're going to create cracking on your skin.

When you get into a bath where you have moisture in there and you have milk in the water, you have some vinegar and you have some sea salt, it's going to help you attract with a magnetic force of all those substances to help pull those toxins out of your skin.

So, your skin isn't going to have to work as hard.

If you're in a sauna or a steam room, your skin gets damaged.

.

(67) Soy Fed Chicken - Less Better
[Aajonus]

Well, no

Rosie is a terrible chicken.

Rocky Junior.

Rosie feeds theirs 75% to 80% soy.

Soy has to be cooked and processed.

Raw soy will kill a human and will kill birds.

So, they have to treat the soy before they feed it.

So, it doesn't matter that the soybean was raised organically.

Once it's treated with a solvent.

It is a chemical.

It is no longer organic.

So, it is a lie, it's misrepresented.

It's miss advertising.

Rosie organic is not organic.

Rocky Junior, the[Kathyy feed theirs 75-80% raw corn.

The rest of it is soy, but I can't get them to stop feeding them soy.

[Attendee]

They're feeding them a certain amount of soy.

[Aajonus]

Soy, but it's a small amount compared to Rosie or any other chickens?

Sheldon does the same thing.

[Attendee]

What about James' chicken, is that alright.

[Aajonus]

James gets Rocky?

[Attendee]

Why do they feed them soy.

[Aajonus]

Soy's an easy protein, fatten them up, build the muscle?

[Kathy]

It's not gonna bother you if you get that 20% in you.

[Aajonus]

Your body can handle it?

If it's eating enough fat.

.

(68) Stye - Use Lemon
(69) Swordfish Aajonus Fav Fish
[Attendee]

Swordfish is okay

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it's still my favorite?

.

(70) Third Worl Countries Parasites From Carbs
[Aajonus]   And there are some people who are in third world countries that live completely on cooked starches, and they don't get meat

So, what happens is they get parasites, and they have to help them eat that sugar decay, so it doesn't dissolve their whole body.

Some people die of malnutrition.

They're not dying of the parasite.

They're dying of malnutrition and the breakdown that the advanced glycation end products and acrylamides are causing in their body.

But again, it's a food contamination, it's not the parasite or the bacteria causing the problem.

Flies do the same thing; flies secrete a fluid that dissolves matter.

That's part of their digestion, it happens in the mouth, frogs do the same thing.

[Kathy]   If you eat something from a fly, it lands on the food, it may lay an egg- you may have an egg or something.

[Aajonus]   Even if it puts that fluid down, it's not going to hurt you.

You're not eating enough.

It's not bacteria, we have 23,000 varieties of bacteria in our mouth.

The human being is the most toxic and you're looking at bacteria.

The most toxic salivary juices in the world.

2,300 various bacteria in the human mouth.

How many people have you killed that you bit.

It's all bullshit?

This whole bacteria thing is bullshit.

The main enzyme we have is the Tylen enzyme and that breaks down sugar.

[Kathy]   It's the same thing if a dog bites you, you're not gonna get rabies.

[Aajonus]   Not likely?

.

(71) Too Much Milk Causes Mineral Buildup
[Attendee]

Um, I have been doing a lot of strength and health

And recently I met a dance teacher and I spent four days doing all these dances I've never done before.

And my knees just became swollen, what causes that.

[Aajonus]

It's because you never got married?

[Attendees],[Aajonus]

Laughs

No, what that usually is is toxic fats leaving your knees.

[Attendees]

So, I just overstimulated like a detox from all the dancing because I wasn't used to that kind of hopping.

[Aajonus]

Well, you also have to understand you were a big milk drinker.

You didn't eat a lot of meat for the first three years on the diet.

You mainly ate milk and didn't eat much meat and much butter.

You were a milk drinker.

Milk is highly concentrated in minerals, low in fat, not high enough in fat for the toxic as we are.

So, you just kept collecting a lot of minerals with poisons.

And when it comes out to the joints, it will cause tremendous swelling.

.

(72) Too Much Vege Juice Lose Appeteite For Meat
If an adult drinks a lot of green juice and they lose their appetite for meat, they're drinking too much juice

Green vegetable juice.

.

(73) Vegetable Oils Are Crystals
[2004]

You take a raw vegetable oil and mix it with dirt and in a year it will be rock

You take animal fat and mix it with dirt, it'll mold and become earth.

And it does that in the human body, hardens in the system.

Amber is a rock from resin from a tree.

Almost all your crystals are vegetable oils, vegetable fats.

They don't break down in the system easily and once they've been cooking in the body, they never turn liquid until it reaches 102 degrees.

So, you have to have lots of hot baths from a 102 to 105 degrees, and you have to stay in there for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.

.

(74) Viruses Are Solvents
[2004],[Aajonus]

Just remember, virus are not alive

This whole contagious shit about mosquitoes carrying virus, and all kinds of things.

That's like you taking soap with you and saying that it's contagious.

Soap is not contagious.

It does not self-replicate, I don't care how many homes have tide in it.

You cannot prove that it self-replicates.

The body makes solvent to dissolve compounds in your body.

If you were so toxic that your body can't use a bacteria or a parasite or other live organisms to break that cell down that became tissue, your body has to make a soap, a solvent.

That's what viruses are.

You look at any book, ask any good microbiologists, they'll tell you virus are protein bodies.

They're not alive.

They can't reproduce, but yet they self-replicate.

Hello.

They are soap, they are solvent.

They even admit when you look in any biology book, you cannot find a virus outside of a live cell environment.

Why.

Because the cells are the producing the virus?

They don't self-replicate.

A cell has to manufacture the soap.

We manufacture soap all the time.

We manufacture alcohol all the time.

We'll take a carbohydrate and ferment it in our intestines, take the alcohol we'll make a solvent out of it.

They'll dissolve the toxicity in the system.

That's what a virus is.

It's a refined, specific, highly densified protein body, solvent, that'll just dissolve matter.

It's not the nicest way to get rid of the toxins.

The bacteria and parasites can consume decaying tissue and reduce it to a micro amount of what it was.

It's like we can do 13 pounds of food in a day and pass a half a pound turd the next day.

Well, if a parasite gets ahold of some tissue, it can reduce it to a hundredth of a percent of what it was and reduce that toxicity into a very small amount.

So, it isn't so difficult to get rid of.

When the body uses a solvent, what happens when we use a solvent.

we dilute it with water and then we contaminate everything else?

And we have this whole bucket of contaminated water.

It's the same thing happens in the human body.

We have virus, bacteria, and parasites to help us, detoxification is mitigated.

When our body uses solvents, it's distributed a lot more toxic.

That's why doctors are more afraid of viral meningitis than a bacterial meningitis, because the fluids become immense when we're scraping down all that toxic matter from the nervous system and mostly it's heavy metals, free radicals that go in and do tremendous damage to other areas of the body, which you don't normally destroy when parasites and bacteria are active.

[Attendee]   Talking parasite, are you talking a one cell parasite.

[Aajonus]   I'm talking about any parasite?

[Attendee]   Some of them can kill you.

[Aajonus]   No, they can't?

You die from the treatment of amoebic dysentery, you take antibiotics, it destroys your ability to digest, and you die.

.

(75) What To Drink At Night
[Aajonus]

Drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice

You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, you go to sleep.

[Attendee]

What about in the middle of the night, take a milkshake too.

[Aajonus]

If you wake, yeah?

If you don't wake, set an alarm after 5 hours.

[Kathy]

Or can just have plain milk, right.

[Aajonus]

You can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar?

Milk by itself isn't good at that hour.

[Lewis]

What about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but that's not when you wake up after 5 hours.

[Kathy]

You said you can have 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep, then you get up and haev another 4 ounces.

Is that colostrum.

[Aajonus]

Colostrum is a little different from milk?

it's very different from milk.

[Kathy]

So, colostrum you can have.

[Aajonus]

If you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night, you can have a glass of colostrum?

Higher in fat and hormone, less in sugar.

[Kathy]

So then you'll have a four ounces of milkshakes one time and then have the other four ounces.

[Aajonus]

You could do that?

[Kathy]

But it makes it up to 4 ounces doesn't it.

How many eggs should I put it?

[Aajonus]

It all depends, you know I've got the recipe in the recipe book?

[Kathy]

One egg.

[Aajonus]

No, you could have 1 to 3 eggs?

2 - 3 ounces of cream, and 3 - 5 ounces of milk, depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.

.

(76) Whole Foods Feeds Their Cows Bakery Waste
Whole foods is worse

Whole food feeds theirs 15% bakery waste.

Stale donuts, and they call it natural.

"All natural".
