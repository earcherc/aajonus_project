So this is his liver, is this chicken liver here?

Chicken and beef.

Put some beef in it.

Ok, so it's chicken liver, beef liver, organic of course, and raw milk.

Everything's raw.

And the egg.

Oh, a raw egg too.

Egg, oh.

A lot of times we throw eggs in there too.

Yeah, sure.

And this, I tell you what, the first time he had this I was kind of surprised.

I go, what can we, you know, she was starting to run a little bit low on milk.

She was going to Florida for a month or so and so we needed to come up with something

else.

And I wrote to Aajonus and got this recipe and I fixed it and it's like I smell it and

I go, that smells so good.

And I go, well, you know, I'll give it to him.

And I figure, well, babies, they decide, whatever you give them, that's what they decide tastes

good, you know, to some degree.

And I gave him a bottle this size, he was what, eight, nine months old I think.

So he wasn't nearly as big as he is now.

And he sucked that thing down in the scene like 30 seconds.

Wow.

I mean, he took it and he just started sucking.

And it was the most amazing thing.

Oh, yeah.

And he just did really well with it.

And so, you know, we just, that's 95% of his diet.

You know, sometimes he gets a little bit of fruit or, you know.

I was giving him vegetable juice and Aajonus says, don't give it to children.

I'm going, he loves vegetable juice.

He likes everything.

He loves raw food.

He'll get into it.

Yeah.

Wow, that's interesting.

Well, you know, I, without the bottle and all that, that's one of my favorite things.

Yeah.

Because we mix up liver, put in onions and honey and milk.

Right.

So, you know, it's a small amount of liver for.

Onions would help a lot with that.

Yeah, because liver and onions is always one of my favorite.

And I just never had it raw.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, we don't take huge amounts of it, just, but, you know, we probably could.

I mean, I love his enthusiasm.

He drinks four bottles so far today.

Really?

Yeah.

He'll drink another one or two.

Another one or two.

Oh, fantastic.

And later at 9 o'clock, we'll have one bottle.

In the middle of the night, one bottle.

Oh, wow.

Five or six bottles a day.

So, you know, it's like, he never gets sick.

I mean, he had a runny nose a little bit for an hour or two here.

He had a little bit of diarrhea.

I think we had some liver that just didn't look right.

And so he had a little diarrhea.

But that might just be detoxing too.

Some old toxins in his body just coming out, you know.

But he's generally pretty cheerful and strong and.

Yeah.

He's a good boy.

Well, you know, we missed at the beginning.

I would like you to introduce yourself.

Give me your name and your permission for this to end up on the Internet.

Oh, my God.

On the Internet?

Possibly.

Okay, so my name is Jeff Cantley.

This is Max Cantley.

And this is my beautiful wife, Lene.

Oh, yeah.

And when we found out she was pregnant, we talked about, you know,

well, what's the best thing to do?

And so she agreed to try, you know, Agenis' diet.

Yeah, I can understand it.

I didn't eat the raw food before, but I heard this idea.

I said, I can understand.

Yeah.

I want to try.

So you did, huh?

I did, yeah.

So she's very, very healthy the whole time.

And, you know, her skin looks great and everything.

Yeah.

I mean, she looks good.

So anyway, so she did that for the whole pregnancy.

And then after he's born, she did it the whole time that. . .

Breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding.

And then after that, she goes, I miss my Chinese food too much.

And so any time she starts to feel a little sick, she goes back to it,

and she goes, I know this is the right way of eating.

It's really funny.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, the whole idea that I'm aware of is people make up their own minds,

you know what I mean?

Right.

It's the best.

Yeah, it works.

Anyway, so. . .

How old is he now?

16 months.

So he just whacked himself.

I mean, another nice thing is he'll climb up on the table, you know,

and it's just like he'll fall or something sometimes, and he just gets--I mean,

he cries for a little bit, and he just gets up, and you never know what happened.

He's really tough.

Yeah.

With a lot of energy and good nature.

Was it a natural childbirth?

Yeah.

Yeah, it was a natural childbirth.

Wow.

It was actually hard labor.

It was two pushes, wasn't it?

Wow.

Two pushes, and he was out.

Fantastic.

Yeah.

Well, maybe we'll watch him--he wants to do something on the other end of this.

Oh, yeah.

Maybe he can climb up on his little ladder over there.

Well, yeah.

There's somebody you guys have to meet.

He's got a baby about maybe two years older than Max,

with a natural childbirth, and his whole life, you know, completely raw.

Just like he is, you know, just happy, healthy.

You know, it looks at you, and you know he's right there.

Well, that's one thing.

Ajahn said to--you know, when he wrote me about the formula, he goes,

Listen, you know, the babies that are like this, he says,

Like he's got one of them that's five years old in fourth grade.

I'm going, Well, that's what we want.

Yeah, right.

I saw that kid, too.

I saw that kid.

I know which one he's talking about.

That kid is amazing.

He lives on the East Coast.

We went there.

We visited there to get raw milk when we were in Manhattan.

We just took a little bus across to New Jersey, got some raw milk,

and I saw this kid sitting there playing, completely content with himself.

He was about two then.

Yeah.

[laughter]

I'm going to have to edit you, Max.

Yeah.

It's pretty fun.

Yeah.

So this is what we have to put up with all the time with this guy.

He just has so much energy.

Sometimes I just couldn't make it.

He sleeps one or two hours during the day, and that's it.

All the time running, I have to play with him.

I couldn't make it.

Wow.

You've had other children before, right?

Yeah, I have two children.

Not healthy.

I see.

I have to say that.

My daughter says, Okay, now I have to feed my baby raw milk, raw liver.

Yeah, yeah.

No kidding.

All right.

[baby crying]

Okay, back off now.

[baby crying]

Yeah.

That's it, grab it.

[laughter]

You want to come up here?

All right.

Well--

[baby crying]

Not getting it?

No, I am.

Yeah.

You're the star, my man.

You're the star.

[baby crying]

That's it.

[baby crying]

That's it.
