Ladies and gentlemen, we pride ourselves on presenting a variety of approaches not only to cancer but to life

You've just heard a talk on enzymes and cancer enzyme therapy

And we've had a number of different therapies and approaches today

well our next guest is

Similar theory a little different approach

He comes to us by way of a technical degree in computer programming and systems analysis

Which seems not perhaps not to be compatible with some of what we're discussing

But an event in his life mainly multiple myeloma

Kind of changed the course of his life and so the search for a

Chance a way to treat it that's effective and safe led him into a totally new way of living and

Our author our friend Aajonus Vonderplanitz is going to tell us now about raw foods and cancer

Aajonus Vonderplanitz

Hello everyone

Probably this is going to be the opposite of everything you've heard before

I'm called the upside-down man. I

Had multiple myeloma

Which is cancer the blood and bone very few people survive I?

Was I started with a an ulcer and it was treated it ended up tumorous

They treated that with surgery and radiation and that gave me the blood and bone cancer multiple myeloma and

Then they treated that with chemotherapy and ended up with lymphoma

And they left me crippled. I was practically paralyzed from the

chest down

To maneuver I had to roll off the couch and crawl with my elbows

To the kitchen or to the bathroom it would take me sometimes 30 minutes I

Would have to rest sometimes up to 30 minutes at a time just to go 10 feet I

Decided that the doctors had not a clue of what had any anything to do with health

So I abandoned them left them completely and began the study of nutrition

It turned my life around very gradually it took me 13 years to find a particular diet that would work

In my book we want to live I

give a lot of the

Testimonials the

Experiences of people who have tried this particular diet

Now you've heard. I'm sure about people should not eat meat

That meat is carcinogenic that meat will poison you

That is true

However, if you eat it raw it is just the opposite

There are many cultures that thrived on raw meats and raw foods

If you cook meat you form heterocyclic amines and lipid peroxides

which are carcinogenic and over a long period of time these collect all

Cooked foods create that in

cooked carbohydrates no matter of its fruit or

grains or

potatoes or

any kind of potato product they form

advanced glycation end products

New York City Medical University did research on advanced glycation end products, and they found that

The byproduct of advanced glycation end products, that's when you use

glycogenous fuel like we use fuel and we end up with

Monoxides

We have advanced glycation end products that form now. They found that in a healthy body. They stored a rate of

70% that means every time you eat a carbohydrate whether it's raw or cooked a fruit a

grain

Cookie no matter what it is you will store

70% of that toxin if you're healthy

90% of your unhealthy

Basically this is an argument against the human body

being a

grain eater or a fruit eater

That's why so much diabetes is developed

What happens with this advanced glycation end product the body tries to ward it off with fats it can't find the proper fats

so it binds with bile and

Other hormones like adrenaline and it causes plaquing throughout the system. We find the cholesterol is really not the problem

cholesterol involved in in bile and all forms of

Chelation processes to neutralize and prevent toxins from damaging the system

What this does is it creates a great environment for cancer because cancer thrives

in a glycogen like environment

So those people who eat grains who eat carrot juice

That's a risk

All of the ones that I follow to be eating carrot juice and high carbohydrate foods like beets

Go into remission for a while and then end up having cancer again

now I put my

Multiple myeloma and my other cancers and by the way, I had four other

incurable diseases

Diabetes psoriasis and gynepectoris and bursitis all incurable all extremely painful

With a particular diet that I use which is all raw foods. I don't even cheat

All raw foods I eat raw milk lots of raw eggs

raw meats chicken

fish

beef lamb

all of them

It reversed all of my diseases I did the raw food

Vegetarian fruitarian

program in my exploration experimentation for six and a half years

After six and a half years it started decomposing my bone and other tissue

That's when I found the raw meat because it was my only promise

The Eskimo before the Germans brought in cauldrons didn't cook a thing

99% of their diet was meat

animal products

They had absolutely no degenerative disease

The first degenerative disease and an Eskimo was found in a 50 year old man who had been living in a German colony

German and British colony eating man's white man's food, which was

lots of breads and sugars

He developed a

Dental carry they had no

Cavities not even cavities the first case of cancer in the Eskimos was until 1934

Then you take a look at the Maasai tribe in Africa

nothing, but raw milk raw blood fresh mixed together equal portions and

raw meats

They are considered the healthiest tallest strongest smartest tribe in the world

They know vegetation

Now because I was not raised a raw footer

I was very toxic and very sick, and I was very sickly as a child so by the time I was 19

I had developed my cancer of the stomach

And went from there, so what I found was my blood gets very acidic

So to counterbalance that what I do is have four cups of green vegetable juice a day

About 60 percent 60 to 80 percent celery 20 percent parsley, and I will use summer squash

like zucchini or

Cucumber or the funny-looking 50s flying saucer looking

squash and

that in between

My meals and I keep it very methodical. I have my juice when I wake up to make sure my bloods alkalinized

then I'll have meat or a smoothie with raw milk and raw eggs and

Then I'll have meat or vice versa, and then I'll have juice again, and I do that pattern all day long

I've done it with hundreds of people with terminal illnesses

not just cancer and

98 percent of the time it reverses it

That doesn't mean it completely goes into remission

But it completely reverses all conditions

Out of all of the heart conditions

Where we have all kinds of you know whether it's placking or a collapsed arteries it reverses

85% of it

Diabetes it controls completely so you no longer have to take insulin

it is a far stretch for most people, but it is a

Moderately expensive way to go about it because if you're looking to replace your enzymes destroyed in your cooked foods

You're playing with your gambling because you don't know exactly what enzymes you

Particularly are going to need to counterbalance the toxins that are formed in the cooked food as well as the missing is not

enzymes

What happens when you eat a cooked food is that your lip your pancreas has to send out?

hormones to go to every cell and say I

Need you to give me enzymes and vitamins and nutrients

We've got a load of food here that we're going to have to handle

And we don't have the enzymes to do it because they've been destroyed

We've had to recycle it to means we have

Lipid peroxides we have advanced glycation end products. We have all these toxins and nothing to handle them with

If you're eating them raw you don't have to do that so every time you eat a cooked meal you're leeching from your body's own

Constitution so you're weakening yourself if you eat raw foods all the time you're always supplying them

Now I found that if you drink two cups of the vegetable juice a day it takes care of the additional enzymes and alkalinity

necessary to balance the body

If you eat an extra drink an extra two cups

Then you'll be resupplying very gradually all of the enzymes lost

throughout the years of eating cooked foods

It makes a lot of sense

But because we have so much

confusion about

raw

bacteria and

the

inavailability of

some foods like the dairy

And the bacteria phobia that has run it out of the counties

It makes it a little expensive to get it and sometimes difficult to get it, but it can be gotten

in every state

The bacteria issue has all been a theoretical one

It's all assumption presumption

Nobody's proven any of it I

Had a vagotomy

When I had the stomach surgery that means they severed every nerve to my stomach

I do not generate hydrochloric acid

So the medical profession puts me in a class of octogenarians who do not secrete hydrochloric acid

Who they say are in danger of developing?

bacterial and parasitical

food poisoning and danger of death

Just to rile you a little bit I've eaten parasite infested salmon that was undulating with pinworms

It was almost white

Had my feces checked for ten weeks after blood tests did not develop one parasite. I

Also did it with fluke worm infested calf brain and

also with chicken

Infested tripe which is the intestines I did not develop any parasites

The concept that people are eating that you can get parasites and bacterial poisoning

from

Your raw meats is not a fact

I've done laboratory tests with animals and was not able to produce

The worms in those animals in any case I've been not able to produce them in my own body

All your degenerative tissue that exists in your body

Attracts and creates and gestates

Worms if you are in need of them

One particular test I did where I used dogs and cats who were already

fluke infested

Not all the same type of flukes because finding them the same types and getting enough animals that already had them

So we didn't have to infuse them

So we were not able to distinguish whether they had you know

It's not a put in as many categories to say here these all had brain flukes

These all had intestinal flukes

So we just put them all together, but we had an equal number of casts equal number of dogs and we had three groups

one of the groups

the first group a

regular kibble and canned food

They got

group a of one had

pharmaceutical dewormers

group a

B both group 1 B had

homeopathic dewormers or herbal dewormers

Group 2 got all raw foods raw meats raw butter

raw eggs

These were cats and dogs

They also got they were split up into two groups pharmaceutical and herbal or homeopathic

group 3 got no dewormers and just the raw foods in

group 1 a and B

40 to 60 percent died and those that recovered were pretty lethargic in

group 2 a and B

The reduction who were on raw foods the reduction of death was down from 10 to 25 to 30 percent on

group 3 there were no deaths

Group 3 took a lot longer to heal because they had to deal with the parasites

But when we finished the test after six months they were all like puppies and chicken kittens

Even if they were 13 to 15 years old

After some of them died we did you know later over the years we did autopsies on them and found that the tissues were quite

renewed

so the only conclusion that we could come to was that the parasites fed on the degenerative tissue and

That because the raw meat was available for them to regenerate tissue quickly

There was no ulceration which is the danger in parasites

the University of Toronto in

Association with the hospital for sick children of Toronto has been using the varitoxin

produced by E. Coli

To completely dissolve brain tumors in a matter of five to seven days including the vessels going to it

Dr. Lowe at Yale has been doing the same thing with the toxin from

Salmonella and actually the salmonella to eat up tumors

So you don't have to be afraid of bacteria

Some people will get get diarrhea and some people will get nausea because you have bile that starts dumping

Into the stomach and colon and that is the only

Side effect when one begins sometimes eating raw meats because the raw proteins will cause that kind of a detoxification

But the people who've bared with it and gone through it all develop

Wonderfully now I have not exercised in 21 and a half years

This is my exercise standing up here or on my computer, and this is from eating raw meat

And I stay this way and my clients stay this way you've been on it for about three years or longer

You do not have to worry about anything other than eating food that gives you life, and it's already full of the enzymes

This is a way for a very few people, but if this is the way you want to go. It's available and

I'll be signing my book out in the in the foyer

After this and it's very available. Thank you very much

Audience thank you very much and ladies and gentlemen you don't necessarily have to rush out now because he'll be here

Actually for the next three days. He'll be with us the Sunday conference

Monday and then the doctor symposium on Tuesday as well
