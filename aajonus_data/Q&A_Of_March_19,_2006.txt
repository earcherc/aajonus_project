(1) Aajonsudoesnt Exercise, How Much Aajonus Eats On Weight Gain & Loss
[2006],[Aajonus]

Cause I don't run, I don't even walk

I do walk three miles a month.

[Attendee]

I mean, you do have to lose your weight somehow with energy, that's a fact.

You take in food, how do you use it then.

[Aajonus]

I just eat lots of eggs?

[Attendee]

You eat a three pound of meat a day.

[Aajonus]

No, I eat 1 - 3 pounds a day.

I average two pounds a day.

[Attendee]

And how many eggs do you eat a day.

[Aajonus]

If I'm on a weight loss, only about 1/2 - 1 pound of meat a day and I'll eat up to 30 eggs a day?

[Attendee]

On the weight loss.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

Not the weight up.

[Aajonus]

Oh, let me tell you?

Eggs will take the weight off quickly.

I made that diet to let people come down slowly.

[Attendee #2]

Really slowly.

[Aajonus]

Laughs then bring down the meat and eat more eggs.

.

(2) Aajonus Heart Scan , Sugar Test, Physical Tests
[2006],[Attendee]

Is your strength good

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Tthree years ago I went through testing in St.

Louis at Washington University Medical School.

And there was a team of cardiologists which were examining raw fooders who had had to be least raw footers for five years and they wanted to take a look at me cause of the high fat diet, their cardiologist, thinking fat, this guy's gonna have plaque all over his heart, arteries, everything.

And you figure, when I was 15.

5, I started with the angina, which is an older person's disease, but they have plaqued arteries and heart and they have to constant heart attacks.

And I probably had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15.

5 til I was 22, and 50 of them caused me to pass out.

So that was like 8 or 9 a year that it caused me to pass out, which isn't so many, but I never died and only a few times did I get taken to the hospital.

But I was out of it by the time I got there and was examined out of the heart attack.

So, there was no need to revive me.

And that's probably just cause people are older when it happens, it's harder for them to recover.

So, here I was at this University of Washington's medical school, they have a sonogram, that's how they tell the plaque and usually it takes 'em about 10 minutes, 7 -10 minutes, and they're satisfied.

They stayed on me for almost 25 minutes.

Looking, looking, looking, look, look, look looking.

Couldn't find any.

They just found some here and the choroidal artery, but that was heavily plaqued when I was 15 years old.

So, there was hardly any, there was just a little bit in that artery, plaque.

Will probably go away in the next 10 years.

They were so impressed cause I'd been a juvenile diabetic and they say juvenile diabetics never heal, so the pancreas is dead and that is it.

They gave me a sugar glucose tolerance test, and it's the first time I had had sugar since 72 or 73.

So man, I was just buzzing.

I mean, I tried to write something and the blood pressure had my hand moving so much I couldn't keep standing and they'd take the blood every half hour and test it to see your sugar level.

And usually around the fifth test, which is three hours later, 2.

5 hours later, it's usually around 102 - 104, and then the stops.

Mine went all the way down to 54.

They said I had the strongest, healthiest pancreas that they've seen.

Right after that kinda sugar because they measured the insulin too, so the insulin was high.

See in diabetics, there's no insulin.

So, the sugar level is high because there's no insulin.

Mine dropped with insulin, ripped it out.

Controlled the toxic sugar.

[Attendee]

What kind of sugar did they use.

Cookie or?

[Aajonus]

No, no, no?

They give it to you in a liquid, its a syrup.

[Attendee]

If you converted that into the whole box of Oreo cookies.

[Aajonus]

It'd probably be what's equivalent into a package and a half Oreo cookies?

Let's say a box of sugar cubes that is about like this.

Probably about 15 sugar cubes of sugar.

[Attendee]

So, it's not a normal amount sugar.

[Aajonus]

That's the way they test it.

[Attendee]

I'm surprised you would let them give you that.

[Aajonus]

I wanted to see, I wanted to know.

I did not let them x-ray me though, they wanted to X-ray me.

[Attendee]

What did they want to x-ray.

[Aajonus]

My chest, heart and all of that bones?

He was so impressed cause the head of the cardiology division of that university in that medical school is a famous world renowned sports cardiologist for the US Olympics team and athletes all over the world.

So, he was really impressed.

He says, "Can we do some more tests on you".

And he says, "You've only agreed to do these"?

And I said, "Sure, do some more tests, what you wanna do".

And they said, "Well, one thing you have to the gym and see how you perform"?

And I said, "I haven't performed since 1970.

Haven't done any exercise and lifted any weights, done anything like that since 1979, but let's go do it".

He said, "Okay, we'll take it easy".

I don't know how much of a test it's gonna be if you take it easy, you know.

So, we went up to this top floor, and they had an indoor track and they had all of these electrode machines where you hook yourself up and through a radio wave that sends it back to the machine so they can register everything?

Heart, the brain, the pulse, everything.

So, they wired me up, they glued all the the electrodes to me and I had to sign another lease.

First they put me on the leg press, see how much weight I put, they started me off of 40 pounds.

I said, "Why don't we start with 90".

"No, no, no, no?

We got to do this right.

You know, I'm not gonna get sued because you get hurt".

Said, "Okay, just wasting a lot of time", he went up 20 pounds each time, so he got up to about 260 pounds with the legs and then I went struggle and he said, "Okay, that's enough", but it took 260 for me to start showing strain, I probably could have done about 320, something like that with heavy strain.

So, then it was the bench press.

So, I got up to 190 before I was like this struggle.

And he said, "Okay, that's enough".

So as soon as I show a good sign of pushing hard, then he stopped the exercise.

So, I got up to 190 and then he put me on the track.

So, I did five minutes on the track, but every time I did an exercise, my heart was regular within three minutes.

It was on the high side of normal after a 90 seconds.

He said, "I've never seen anything like this before.

I have people who workout, three, four days a week that can't do what you", he says "You're no youngster".

I was in my mid fifties when those tests were done.

.

(3) Aajonus Property
[2006],[Aajonus]

Thailand, also to satisfy me, 10% of the patient basis will be completely free and they will be the poor people at Thailand

There will be some kind of work exchange for some people, I'm gonna arrange for all types of ways to get people in.

But your normal therapists and everything like that have to be Thai.

It has to be so many in order to do it in Thailand, a great percentage of the workforce has to be Thai.

[Attendee]

The way the system hits here in this country is so heartbreakingly, young people and they can't afford different things to heal themselves.

They have through whatever the insurance will give them.

[Aajonus]

In Aruba, now that I have my PhD, my clients there are arranging there with the government, they've already set it up.

When the health center gets open, they have their own health system there, and it's for everybody and it's free, it's like in Canada, so they will fly the people to the health centre in Costa Rica and pay for it completey.

[Attendee]

Their own people.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, in Aruba?

[Attendee]

If people going from America or from another country they have to pay.

[Aajonus]

It's going to change?

It's just like Campbell Insurance Company, they ensure certain firms, certain workforces, they paid my bill even when I wasn't a PhD.

They paid, the cost of coming in to consult from the work.

That insurance company pays alternative therapy cause they know they work.

[Attendee]

Do you belong to them.

[Aajonus]

No, I don't?

I have patients.

.

(4) Algae and Plankto, Why Fish Have Mercury
[2006],[Aajonus]

You have to understand that plankton and algae, they're plants, they eat rock

So, whatever's in the rock, they eat it and make it something good and we could eat them and do fine cuz planktons a cross between a fish and a plant, so they can handle it.

You know, the theory is because plankton eat so much mercury that the animals who eat them, like the swordfish, is a highly toxic animal, but it isn't.

Swordfish can move so fast because they know how to utilize the mercury favorably.

It isn't like the mercury they use in injections and it's like, science says, "Well, we've made this radiation.

The radiation that you get is just like the sun".

No way it's anywhere near like the sun, isn't produced the same way at all.

And the arrogance to say that same quality as the sun is ludicrous.

.

(5) Brewery Grains
[2006],[Attendee]

The eggs that I buy, I talk to the farmer on how he feeds the chickens, and he said part of the feed that he gives is scraps around the farm

But a lot of the feed is what's left over after the breweries run water through grains to make beer.

Is that bad.

[Aajonus]

It's not great?

[Attendee]

It didn't sound too good to me.

[Aajonus]

No, it's not good at all.

We get our eggs from Lily and they run around on 10 acres.

She does feed them some meat byproducts, although she's not supposed to, she does.

She has an area, two acres for the eggs we want.

[Attendee]

So, do you get the same eggs in the stores here.

[Aajonus]

No, she feeds them wrong?

They're the same except she doesn't feed them any raw meat scraps.

[Attendee]

We don't have good source of eggs down here.

[Aajonus]

You need somebody to run up to Los Angeles weekly.

[Attendee]

We get it once a month.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but you could do it once a week.

.

(6) Coconut Cream Detox, Lack Of Dairy
[2006],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

When I was in Burma, I drank a bunch of coconut milk after I got outta-

Coconut water

[Attendee]

Coconut milk?

They would take the coconut and they would put it through a grinder.

And you know, they would take all the meat and ground it and that's what they'd give me, and they would do like five or six coconuts, I'd end up with about a quart.

[Aajonus]

Coconut cream.

[Attendee]

Coconut cream, right.

And I had sugar cane juice on the street, same thing.

They just took a sugar cane through like a hand grinder.

And I was eating raw eggs to offset the fact that I had eaten so many fried foods during the meditation retreat I was at.

Mm-hmm.

I lost about 20 pounds at this retreat, you couldn't eat past noon every day, but was that a good thing to do for my body.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

Clean out the stuff.

[Attendee]

And then what happened was I experienced an extreme amount of diarrhea for like two weeks.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely, you will with that much coconut cream.

My God.

Lucky you didn't go every hour.

[Attendee]

But so that was a good clean.

[Aajonus]

Absolutely.

May have demineralized you to some extent, so eating cheese when you returned would've been the best thing to do.

Lots of cheese.

[Attendee]

Yeah, I started doing butter.

[Aajonus]

Not after doing that regime and being mineral deficient, you won't digest the fat.

If you're going to eat the lubrication formula, you have to eat it with a lot of cheese.

[Attendee]

So, it's safe to do that.

You could drink a bunch of coconut cream?

[Aajonus]

Depends upon the individual, like I said, it could demineralize the system too fast?

[Attendee]

But if you ate cheese with it to keep the minerals.

[Aajonus]

Have you made a coconut cream cheesecake.

It's very nice?

Depends how hungry you are.

I've been so hungry I downed a pint, of course I had diarrhea for two days.

[Attendee]

I think 3 oz (6 tbsp) is enough for me.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, me too most of the time, but when I'm in Asia and I can't get dairy, I'll consume at least a cup of it a day.

[Attendee]

Is it a good substitute for the dairy.

[Aajonus]

Not really?

It's not building, it's cleansing, but it's a fat that I have to have.

I eat so many more eggs, sometimes I eat up to 40 a day.

I still eat meat there.

I can get lots of meat.

It's just that I'm so used to having so much dairy fat, cream and the butter, heaven.

And it just stabilizes my body, really grounds me.

And then when I'm there in Asia for seven weeks at a time, and by the fifth week, I start downing that coconut cream more often.

.

(7) Coconut Cream Rips Up Metals
[2006],[Attendee]

Can you buy the jars full of the virgin coconut

[Aajonus]

If ou take one of those jar lids that are metal and you put coconut cream on it, within about an hour it turns gray, starts ripping the metals up?

You put that oil on it, it could take a week.

So, coconut cream that does it.

[Attendee]

It pulls out more toxicity is what you're saying.

[Aajonus]

Metal toxicity?

Well, it pulls out anything.

It can dissolve lymphatic plaque.

It can dissolve in almost anything.

.

(8) Coconut Machine
[2006],[Aajonus]

I bought to make coconut cream in Thailand arrives tomorrow at the lot

So, I'm gonna train people how to use it cause they trained me in Thailand.

So, these machines are great.

It's like the Greenstar Gold that's about 4.

5 feet long.

It's stainless steel.

It's about this high off the ground.

So, you could do 50 gallons an hour.

50 gallons an hour.

They're so fast.

I bought three machines, one to take the shell off the coconut.

Those guys can do a de-shell a coconut in three seconds, three seconds.

It takes me about 20 seconds.

I've only just learned how to use the machine, but 20 seconds is very quickly to get the whole shell off.

Then there's a machine to take the broken pieces, then we break it, the coconut and put it in the machine that grates it, and then we put the grated coconut through the juicer.

.

(9) Coconut Oil 1 Tbsp A Day
[2006],[Attendee]

Do you recommend eating that for us

[Aajonus]

One tablespoon a day?

[Attendee]

You do recommend it though.

[Aajonus]

Well, it's oil?

If you're having coconut cream, you don't need it.

because you're gonna get oil already in the coconut cream.

But it's all alternative to eating, let's say, olive oil.

Definitely better alternative than flax oil.

[Feel free to listen to the rest, but I didn't feel it was worth transcribing]

.

(10) Coconuts Are Often Bad
[2006],[Attendee]

Like 2/3 are bad

[Aajonus]

Well, that's only cuz you're getting ones that are already out.

When you get fresh bags in, it's usually 8-9/10 good.

It's just that when they're in the stores, the Mexicans and all the people who know how to choose coconuts and use coconuts a lot, they get the first pick and they know the good ones, so you get left out.

[Attendee]

I heard they soaked them in mold retardent before they ship them.

[Aajonus]

Some of them, yeah.

If you see real white skin outside, yeah.

[Attendee]

Does it matter.

[Aajonus]

But if they're light brown, they're not?

Well, it doesn't really get to the heart of the coconut.

They can be light brown and dark brown.

No.

If they still have hair on them.

If the hair's off, they'll always turn dark brown.

Medium to dark brown.

[Attendee]

Have you seen the ones at Henrys, they're packaged fantastic and they're very, very dark and they're scored around.

Have you seen those.

[Aajonus]

They don't soak those in mold retardent?

[Attendee]

You don't think it matters.

You would still use them.

[Aajonus]

No, we've got a good source of coconuts?

[Attendee]

How do you have a good source.

[Aajonus]

Because James Stewart, who runs our co-op, that's what he did for 30 years, was buy and sell produce, so he knows every contact there is, organic produce?

He's one of the first ones started organic produce business way back in the early 70s.

I tell him what I know about being in the fields, what's going on out there, between the two of us, we get the best stuff.

[Attendee]

We'll be having coconut, he'll make it every week.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, every week?

Make it every week.

Keep it in glass.

[Attendee]

So, you'll make it and we'll be able to buy it from you.

[Aajonus]

Well, I'm not gonna make it.

I just bought the machinery and I'm gonna train them how to use it and make it.

.

(11) Cooked Fat Swollen Tissue, Aajonsu Bdy Shrinking, Cooked Fooders Losing Height
[2006],[Attendee]

I've noticed since I've been on this diet my bags under my eyes have swelled up

.

.

swelling on the diet.

[skip to 00:36 on audio],[Aajonus]

No, it usually decreases over time for most people.

However, if yours had been very thin and starting to cirrhos, which means harden, then more fluid would be brought into that area to try to keep it from hardening together.

So, you'd have more circulation.

So, it could be just temporary, could take six, seven years.

That's pretty temporary when we figure it takes 40 years to clean the body completely.

I'm only 34 years into the raw diet.

But that was the eating meat for 34 eating years since 76.

It was 30 years of eating raw meat and I didn't start eating it on a daily basis until 82.

So, it's 26 years of eating meat on a daily basis, but in the last three years, my bones have gotten small, but more dense, no osteoporosis, nothing like that.

It's a trunk.

When you eat cooked fats, cooked foods, the fat molecule swell from 10x - 50x their normal size.

A good example I like to use is John Travolta.

Remember how tall and lanky and thin he was when was 30 years old that.

Well, you see him just slightly starting to get bigger by the time he's 30 and then after that to his 30s and 40s, tremendous swelling.

I mean, this guy used to be tall and lanky and now he's huge and thick in his bones eating all that cooked food.

It does that to a lot of men.

Take a look at Russell Crowe.

Same way, very slender.

Remember he was that nude robot in one film and then you see him in the gladiator the other film and he's huge and you see all these actors going from very thin to really swollen bodies as they get older.

Mine is doing the reverse because I'm not contaminating it.

So, I've gone from, you know, my body fat I used to like to keep it minimum 27% body fat, and that's what most women have, not men.

And most athletic men have body fat about 7%, and I used to keep 27% minimum for me, and that's what I like.

Now, I don't need as much fat, so I'm about 22% body fat.

Do I look like I'm 22% body fat.

I've got abs that are cut?

It looks like I have 7% body fat in the people who eat cooked foods, but I have 22% body fat.

Three weeks ago, I was 20% body fat.

That was a little slimmer, but my waist is now 29" - 30" waist.

When I had blown up from everything, it went up to 37" - 38" waist.

My chest, it swelled up to 40" - 41".

It's back down on the 36".

So, it's taken me 34 years to get to this point to be where I was when I was 16 years old.

[Attendee]

Have you shortened in height.

[Aajonus]

Not at all?

Havn't shortened a bit.

Exactly.

5' 7" 3/4, exactly where it was at 16 years old.

[Attendee]

That's good.

I was wondering when you said you both got smaller.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Not in height, but it's just width.

And all my brothers have shrunk.

My dad went from 5' 6" - 5' 4", he is 5' 3" something.

And my youngest brother who was 6' is down to 5' 10".

He's three years younger than I am, so he'll be 56 this year or he's just 56 in January.

He's three years younger than I and he's already dropped almost 2"

No, no, no.

You started wearing down the cartilage.

My cartilage isn't wearing.

Everywhere, vertebrates, everything.

All the cartilage whittles and people just start droppings, whittles away.

.

(12) Dairy Importance
[2006],[Attendee]

I just wanna ask about dairy, there has been a number of people, I don't take a lot of names of the Yahoo site, but a lot are going off dairy on this site

[stopping drinking dairy],[Aajonus]

You have to understand that from my talking to the people that run that site, they get a lot of people who are really vegetarians that feel that dairy is wrong, and they get on the internet and start telling people stories.

[Attendee]

I know, it's just stupid.

[Aajonus]

And it's not nice.

They have their agenda, which is to stop the people from eating dairy.

[Attendee]

So, you do believe that theory is really important in this diet for the minerasl, for the fat, for what.

[Aajonus]

For everything?

It stabilizes people.

I mean, I've tried diet with just eggs and meat and the amount of stability is impossible to reach.

The butter is so important for the whole system, stabilizing it and keeping it from getting disease.

And then the cream is so for settling the nervous system and without the milk to supply yourself to so many minerals so quickly.

Cheese is a great absorber.

I mean, such a wonderful tool.

[Attendee]

Yeah, somebody else not here, but I had here, someone said to me that I was making all my milk mainly soured, letting it sit, that you lack some, I don't know what it was said at the time.

You'd lack something if you turn all your milk into acidity with the sour, I should be drinking some non sour, is that correct.

[Aajonus]

That's correct?

[Attendee]

So, I should have what.

Half of it?

[Aajonus]

Well, not necessarily half, you just need some minerals that will not be absorbed as fully?

So, I will take some fresh milk, I'll put it in a bowl of warm water, hot water, and I burned my hand in the hot water for about four seconds.

I'll let it warm and then I'll do warm up and I'll let that sit for an hour in the warm water and stirs cool, but not cold.

And then I'll do it again for another hour and then I'll drink that warm, I'll drink that milk warm.

And I may drink a quart on one or two days a week.

[Attendee]

Why do you drink it warm.

[Aajonus]

Cold milk shrinks the stomach, you don't secrete hydrochloric acid; casein and milk sugar will not digest properly, it gets into the blood when it enters the duodenum undigested?

[Attendee]

Why do you do it twice.

[Aajonus]

Because I like the bacteria to build up a little bit, but bacteria start doesn't start building up until it reaches a certain temperature?

So, I wanted a couple of hours, at least with the bacteria building.

[Attendee]

But we are already having our soured milk anyways.

[Aajonus]

No, I'm talking about fresh milk right out of the refrigerator.

.

(13) Dentist
[2006],[Aajonus]

So, he's been around the field a long time and when I first introduced him to this, he went online, he and spent a month researching natural stuff

[Attendee]

For you.

Are ou talking about the food or?

[Aajonus]

His dentistry?

He'll do anything I say, if I don't want x-rays, if I don't want Novacane.

I had a tooth over here, it's missing and the cap fell off of it and I thought, I'd been on the diet for raw food for 24 years and I was eating a lot of dairy, cheese, and I thought I'd be able to remineralize that tooth and the cap came off it, it just rotted.

It kept breaking off and everything and then there was just that stub in there and I said, "I want to get it pulled, I just want you to go ahead and pull it".

And I said, "What you need to do is you need to cut around the tooth".

So, he says, "I have this tool which goes in and I slide it in and then turn it around and it cuts all the flesh around the tooth", and I said, "That's what I want".

So, he said, "You want me to use the minimum of Novocane".

I said, "I don't want you to use any Novacane, just get in there and do it"?

He shuttered, he went to his father, an older man, probably, probably 65, 66 years old, not much older than I am, and he shuttered too.

He said, "No, you're not gonna do that, are you".

He said, "Yeah"?

So he went in there, pushed in.

I said, "Now what I want you to do is I want you to push it in, gimme a few , seconds to mitigate that pain.

Let that pain wave pass, and then twist, and then let that wave pass and then yank it out".

So, he did exactly that and the thing we didn't know is that the nerve that went all the way up into here had become fibroid, so it was a whole balloon.

So, when we pulled that out, it was harder getting that out than the tooth.

So, it made this big pop sound and the blood went across the room, and he was expecting to go in there and find my mouth full of blood, but it just had that one squirt and my body clotted just like that, stopped it instantly.

No bleeding beyond that spurt out.

But I had this huge sack that had fibroided from that tooth and he was impressed.

He'll do anything that I want.

[Attendee]

On a scale of 1-10, what was the pain.

[Aajonus]

I've gone through so much pain, this is just another one?

It was very brief because when he pushed it in, that was probably a good three seconds of tremendous pain, like you hit a nerve, but then it stopped.

So, it took about 45 seconds to mellow out, to just drop numb.

Then the next one, the same thing, just twist it around, that probably didn't take more than three to five seconds.

It took me about another minute to let minute to let that wave and pain and everything subside and throbbing and blood pressure.

You could feel it pounding with every heartbeat and then the pulling of it, I think that was probably the most pain cause he had to pull that fibroid tissue through that socket.

It was only so big.

.

(14) Did Dairy Make Western Cultures Stronger, Mongolians Blood With Milk
[2006],[Attendee]

Do you think that had a lot to do with Western history developing with the consumption of dairy product in the west

[Aajonus]

I think it developed mainly because, except in Africa, the dairy was produced in very cold climates where there wasn't a lot of food in the winter, lot of things went into hibernation, so dairy was always available and cows didn't freeze?

You'd milk them twice a day.

[Attendee]

You think that the dairy made the Western culture stronger in some ways.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah, definitely?

Absolutely.

[Attendee #2]

That's how Genghis Khan conquered the largest portion of the world.

Mongolians were a meat, dairy society, no vegetable.

[Aajonus]

They also bled their horses so they wouldn't have to carry food like the Maasai.

They didn't do it to the cows, they did it to the bulls.

[Attendee #3]

Not enough to hurt.

[Aajonus]

They'll bleed the bowls for five days.

Blood milk, equal portion taste delicious.

If you've ever had blood, it coagulates pretty quickly, gets thick and it tastes metallic a little bit and it's really fresh and liquid and drinking it right out of the bleeding animal.

It's easy, it's okay, but once it sits in a glass for five minutes, it becomes unappealing to me.

But when you mix it right away with milk, it's like ice cream.

It has no relationship to the taste that it has on its own.

The Maasai are the tallest, strongest, healthiest, smartest tribe in the world, and they're the only ones that on a daily basis for three months a year, and they only drink the blood and the milk together during the times that the cows are lactating for the calves and they don't have enough milk for themselves, so they have to supplement it with the blood.

And they're growing spurts on that three months, every day, several times a day, eating the blood and the milk together is giving this height, the average height there is 7 foot tall.

The tallest person is 9 foot something, smallest man is like 6" 3".

That's a short guy.

[Attendee]

I heard they don't want to have anything to do with western culture.

[Aajonus]

No, they don't.

After Shirley McClain and that whole group for like 28 years, kept bringing donuts and candies and garbage, and the children started getting sick and they saw harming their entire tribe.

They went to the government and said we don't want the white man within 20 miles of our villages anymore, don't want them influencing our children, our people, anything like that.

We will agree to go out to hike 20 miles every day and do rituals and sell our art to the white man, but we don't want him within 20 miles of our villages and the government agreed.

That's the way it stands today.

The only way you ever get to see a Maasai is if he's left the tribe and got in culture.

Like the one Maasai who was a singer who was quite a famous singer, now he's on David Letterman a couple of months ago, extremely bright, bright young man and you can see how well their brain works, they're so calm.

But I had a feeling he left the tribe early and didn't eat entirely because he didn't have the height of the normal Maasai tribe.

He was only about maybe 6' 1".

Well, the Pygmies all only ate heavily cooked foods and they didn't eat any dairy.

Strictly meats and insects always heavily cooked and fried.

Everything fried.

They'd take a slab of lard from a wild pig and they would boil that first and then cook the meat in that.

(15) Diet Msotly Of Raw Fish, Fish Is Fatty
[2006],[Attendee]

Diet predominantly on raw fish

Is that fairly beneficial or is that detrimental.

[Aajonus]

For the people who in tropical areas, I find it's pretty good?

I can't do it, I've tried it.

It's not enough nourishment for me.

I start getting fatigued, I lose too much weight and I'm just hungry all the time and irritable.

Start getting irritable once I get down to a certain weight, so I can't live on it.

There are natives who can, there're lots of Asians who can.

[Attendee #2]

Even if they don't have the fat.

[Aajonus]

Fish are full of fat, high fat?

Almost all fish, there is some that are leaner.

Whenever I buy fish, I buy the fatty section.

I mean really fatty like the tail end of the swordfish.

That's my favorite.

[Attendee]

So, we don't have to worry about mercury in tuna or anything like that when it's raw.

[Aajonus]

The fat of the fish has already dealt with the toxicity, and bound it in fat?

If you cook that fish, you fractionate that bond and that heavy metal does into your system.

And when I did test with swordfish with 12 animals, well 13 counting me, almost 1415, it was broken up into half plus me, eating it raw and half of eating it cooked.

And we took the urine and feces from each animal, had them separate, so we could see that if there was a ratio high difference between the ones on raw and the ones on cooked, what they had to do with digestion or whatever.

So, we checked the urine and the feces, all that was collected in the day for three days after eating the swordfish.

Nothing else was given except for water during that three day period and the lab technician had measured the amount of mercury in the swordfish and how much is in concentration, and then of course how much was given in to each animal and that much mercury.

[sorry it cuts out here]

(16) Dry Sauna
[2006],[Aajonus]

It burns your skin, so if you're gonna do a sauna, it means getting out every three minutes to rinse off, to make sure it doesn't burn into the skin

[Attendee]

Rinse and wipe with the cloth or something.

[Aajonus]

Or just get in there and rinse with a cloth while you're under the shower, but then you're not be cooling your body every three minutes?

[Attendee #2]

Well, these saunas don't have a shower in them, just a room was a lot of dry heat.

[Aajonus]

That's what I mean.

Some are still 168° at the end.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah.

And she's been there for I think 20, 30 minutes or something.

That's not helping her to detox anything.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it is, but it's damaging her skin.

She keeps destroying skin cells, she's gonna have very old skin.

She may be cleaner inside, but she's not gonna be cleaner on the surface.

Especially women, vanity.

[Attendee #2]

So, overall, she's not much better by doing.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah, she's better internally, the lymph glands, everything will be better, but her skin won't?

[Attendee]

What will it look like.

[Aajonus]

Well, it will age and be dead, it will turn into elephants skin?

[Attendee #2]

Wet sauna at the end.

[Aajonus]

No?

Cause then you've got the high steam burning the sinuses and that'll damage mucus production and the lungs too.

[Attendee #2]

She's better off in the bathtub.

[Aajonus]

Bathtub or a jacuzzi?

.

(17) Eating Only Keir Compared To Fresh, How Much Water
[2006],[Attendee]

I love to take cream in hot water, little hot water and a lot of cream

[Aajonus]

Your going to demineralize your bones if you do that.

Cream already demineralizes, that's why I had people using cheese with the cream to bring it down to a certain level and you add water to it, you can really demineralize.

[Attendee]

If you add water to the milk.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

I mean, if you just put a dab of hot water.

It's just a little.

[Aajonus]

Let me pour just a little bit of hot water down your throat and see what happens.

You're only gonna burn the esophagus and part of the stomach in your mouth, but how are you going to eat after that.

You're not gonna eat for a couple weeks and then you may die if you won't be able to eat, unless you're gonna intravenously feed you or put the whole tube in your stomach to feed you?

Same thing happens in the cells, the orifice of the cell is burned solidly shut.

[Attendee #2]

Do you think it's a good idea to keep your milk warmer when making kefir.

Like if you want a certain type of bacteria?

[Aajonus]

If you want to make it quicker.

I just come back from a trip an dI had no warm fresh milk, cultured milk.

I'll put it in a bowl with warmer water.

I'll put honey in it first cause then they'll thicken quickly, within like 15, 24 hours, I have kefir, thick kefir, if I will heat the milk like that three, four times in a 24 hour period with honey it.

[Attendee #2]

I was wondering if there are different types of bacteria where different temperatures might be more beneficial.

[Aajonus]

There probably are, but they're always the same bacteria, just like between a human being and an eskimo?

Or a human being and a tropical.

They're both humans, of course a human Alaskan's gonna tolerate the cold weather more than the tropics.

[Attendee #2]

What's the minimum amount of time.

[Aajonus]

For me, it's two hours?

If I put it in hot water, let that sit in that water for an hour and then I reheat the water again and leave it in there for an hour I can drink it.

There's no problem.

[Attendee]

We were talking about amount of sour milk and ordinary milk.

If you had an idea of what would you say, how much of each.

[Aajonus]

I would say with your system, and most people are very toxic, 2/3 sour & 1/3 fresh?

[Attendee #3]

I've been doing 100% sour.

[Aajonus]

Are you eating cheese.

[Attendee #3]

Yeah?

[Aajonus]

Then probably you're not going to have a problem, but still it's better to have a little bit more fresh.

Kefirs already predigested, it's broken down, so you're gonna get a lot more from it.

But there are certain mineral bonds that don't occur in the sour that are in the milk.

[Attendee #3]

So, should I do a 50/50.

or two?

[Aajonus]

I'd say 1/3?

[Attendee #3]

1/3 regular milk and 2/3 kefir.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

When I did my experiments with eating nothing but kefir, I started getting tremendous gas and diarrhea.

So, you haven't taken it to that point.

I can't do it.

I have to eat 1/3 fresh milk, 2/3 kefir.

[Attendee]

You probably do take quite a bit more milk.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

If I'm eating kefir it's 1 quart per day, if I'm drinking milk, it's two quarts.

[Attendee #2]

I'm not drinking that much.

I'm drinking three quarts a week.

[Aajonus]

Well, I stay away from water.

[Attendee #2]

Well, I don't drink much water either.

You totally stay away from water.

[Aajonus]

During the winter?

probably had a cup of water all week.

Sip here and there.

[Attendee]

What kind.

Does it matter?

[Aajonus]

Well, you should always drink water in glass?

So, it can be Avion if you want flat water, it can be sparkling water, as long as it's naturally sparkling like Gerolsteiner, San Pellegrino.

.

(18) Egg Fat, Dry Mouth Use Honey, Honey and Butter For Mouth Erinkles
[2006],[Attendee]

I mean, I'm like an addict

I'm terrible.

[Aajonus]

It does just the opposite.

[Attendee]

But what does my body want then if it doesn't want that.

[Aajonus]

It needs fat?

[Attendee]

I'm just doing the eggs, 18 eggs a day.

[Aajonus]

18 eggs, those fats burn.

They don't solidify or stay in the body, they burn and remove toxicity.

That's why I say if you eat eggs, people eat 50 eggs a day, they'll lose weight.

[Attendee]

What else do I need to add.

[Aajonus]

Well, you need honey with almost everything you eat?

The fat in honey, I found in my experiments, especially on the mouth, relieves dry mouth more than anything.

You can put butter in your mouth, put cream in your mouth, you can do all kinds of things, meat fat in your mouth, meat fat is the second best, and that will relieve the dry mouth sensation.

But the dry mouth, like I've said before, when the brain detoxifies all those heavy metals, it does it through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands, most of it.

Some of it through the sinuses.

When it comes out, it creates all that plaque around the teeth.

It also causes all the fats in the face because the everything coming down, all up in the nerves and the teeth and all down the gums, those channels outta the brain are ripping all the fats out and all of the skin and flesh.

That's why all tribes who don't eat a lot of fat shrivel at the mouth.

[Attendee]

So, all the eggs are drying.

[Aajonus]

Drawing?

You're not adding any fat, it's gotta be butter, or it's gotta be cream, it has to be coconut cream, things like that.

But if you want to replenish the mouth, the only fats that are absorbed wholly and completely into the cells around the mouth are the fats in the honey.

So, use saliva and honey.

I don't know how well you remember I used to have heavy lines a year ago, all up in upper lip, and just in the last year, I've been extremely using the honey/butter, they're almost all gone.

And I never get dry mouth and dry lips again, unless I go my workshop, long day, talk for eight hours and I don't put the honey and saliva on, then my lips will get dry again and start cracking it.

If I put that honey and saliva in there, I never get dry mouth and that I don't go for water anymore.

Dry mouth is due to brain detoxification.

All the poisons leave the brain, pull fats out of everywhere it comes out.

It's like a magnet, just takes all the fat up its way out.

So, it leaves this whole area dry that's why everybody wrinkles around the mouth heavily and around the eyes cause the tear ducts are constantly flowing it out and then that'll cause dryness around here.

Well, you remember I had 12 layers of skin here in all those years of being on a bad diet and I started putting the honey and and saliva on the forehead about eight months ago and it's down to about four layers.

[Attendee]

Every night.

[Aajonus]

No, I just do it.

I'm not that vein.

I just do it when I feel like.

[Attendee]

You do look different.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it's very different.

I just do it two times a week.

Honey and saliva.

Put the saliva on an area first so it's very moist and I put saliva on your finger again, just dip it into the honey put saliva on top of that.

So, you're just putting a very fine layer so it's barely much.

.

(19) Fried Fat, Stem Cells
[2006],[Aajonus]

Your fat molecule is very sensitive, when you start frying it, you damage your ability to breed stem cells in the body

Without stem cells, you don't grow very well.

If anything's deformed, it will remain deformed.

Everybody knows what stem cells are.

Stem cells are a fatty cell that can become any kind of a cell?

It can become a brain, neuron, or it can become a liver or pancreas, or muscle tissue.

It can become whatever it wants at the time it enters wherever it is.

It enters the heart, become a heart cell.

The body needs arteries instead of a heart cell, it will build an arterial cell.

Such a small amount once you're over 21 years old, very small.

That's why a company one of my patients owns called Thera Vitae take the stem cells from the blood and culture only the stem cells, so you get concentration of them and they inject them in the heart.

I've talked with the physicians there because, they're in the office, all of them and even consultants, all of them, the doctor, and they inject 30 - 40 injections in a heart during the procedure of injecting and the report that I got about a month ago from the physicians who were responsible for the heart patients before they came to Thera Vitae, said that their observation of their patients who had the stem cell injections that the effects after a year and a half were still working.

It still showed progress in the unusual healing of the heart and surrounding area.

One doctor said that a persons pancreas that was beyond borderline diabetic that it healed his pancreas.

It went into his heart, but after a year it started affecting the other gland.

[Attendee]

Do they do it into the liver or anything else.

[Aajonus]

They don't do it right now, they're talking about doing more this year, more organs in other parts of the body, they're gonna start that this year, I think in August or July?

But right now, it's strictly heart.

[Attendee]

So, you think that's quite a good thing to do.

[Aajonus]

It's a wonderful thing?

It's a persons own cells and bred their own blood.

What we're thinking about doing is getting the people to come to the Primal Diet Health Center first for a few weeks to a month before they have this done, so that blood is really good and rich and healthy and then breeding it in that blood serum should even increase and then those 20% that it doesn't work for, this will probably increase their ability to be able to utilize the stem cells.

Stem cell can become any cell.

They're fat cells.

We have fat cells all throughout the blood, white blood cells.

[Attendee]

A stem cell is a fat cell.

[Aajonus]

It's a type of fat cell?

It's a type of white blood cell, but they are differentiated in that they can become any cell.

White blood cells are called the defenders because fat can absorb toxins without being damaged.

It's like fat people, that's why I say fat is so important to get fat if you want to get well quicker.

Cause the fat can arrest the poisons without going into the cell and damage the RNA and DNA and your vitality.

[Attendee]

Does everybody have stem cells.

[Aajonus]

Everybody?

You can find a greatest concentration in the bone marrow.

So, just like we breed the red, white blood cells, self cellular division of the red, white blood cells happens in the bone marrow.

Except in the fetus, you know, they're all over the fetus.

They seem to be breeding everywhere.

(20) Glycerin
(21) Gulf Is Polluted, Aajonus Proeprty, Stem Company, Spas
[2006],[Aajonus]

And I said, well, you know, nobody's offering to buy me a- he said, "How about Costa Rica"

I said, "I checked Costa Rica, too expensive"?

You know the only real estate agency down there is century 21 from America, and they jack the prices up so bad, it's terrible.

I won't live on the Atlantic.

[Attendee]

Why not.

[Aajonus]

Because that's the Gulf and two US nuclear bases dump their nuclear waste there in the Gulf?

Plus you have the Panama Canal, which is very close, and it's all that oil from the tankers.

And some of those tankers are backed up for three weeks to a month, and they're sitting out there spilling all kinds of garbage.

I don't eat anything from the Gulf.

I won't liver there.

So, it's very expensive.

He said, "Well, how about I build it for you".

I said, "Be my guest"?

So, he made a call right there to a friend of his in Costa Rica.

Said, "I need 100 acres.

Get it as soon as you can".

[Attendee]

Would you have both.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

I'd love to have both.

Thailand and Costa Rica.

That'd be perfect cause then all people that are close to Asia and Australia and Europeans would go to Thailand and then all the Americans and South Americans, north or south, could go to Costa Rica.

Thailand is central between China and Australia and I've got a lot of Australians.

In fact, they want me to come in July to Australia is long in Asia.

I'm gonna go to Australia and do a workshop.

[Attendee]

Which part.

[Aajonus]

Brisbane?

It's a Gold Coast trail.

[Attendee]

.

.

.

And that's where I got the butter and the culture cream butter.

And that's the milk that you only buy, it's Cleopatra's Bath Milk.

[Aajonus]

Laughs that's okay.

Doesn't matter what for.

Help build a health center in both Thailand and Costa Rica.

[Attendee]

How's the progress on that.

[Aajonus]

Well, the partners are doing very well with their other company?

They have the stem cell company where they take the stem cells from a person of blood, they have a laboratory in Israel, they take the blood and send it to Israel, to the laboratory, they separate the stem cells from the blood.

They breed it in your own blood serum when they separate it, so it's all natural and they put it with a courier to take it to Bangkok, it goes to the hospital, and then they inject it in the heart.

They got a three year license from the country of Thailand to do experiments on humans because they've been done only on animals and in all animals there was not one case of, of rejection, there was not one case of any side effects.

After two years of doing the tests, the same was for the humans, not one reject cause it's your own stem cells bred in your own blood serum.

It completely reversed 80% of the heart disease.

Where it was mitral valve prolapse or bypass, the body actually builds new arteries to bypass its own arteries in three to six months.

So, it was so extraordinary and the test went so well that eight Nobel Prize winners joined the board of that company, plus the King's own cardiologist.

So, they gave him a license to go ahead and become commercial as of January, so it was a year early.

But because of that, that put me on hold, my health center on hold, the money for the health center cuz now that they have the license already and they know they're gonna do it, they need 13 million to build the laboratory in Bangkok cause they can't keep trucking it back and forth from Israel to Bangkok by messenger.

Too many things could happen cause you have 24 hours to get it into the person once it leaves the land.

So, it's risking it too much and it's only $36,000 right now.

And open heart surgery is anywhere from, you know, $125,000 - $300,000.

And people are going from othe wheelchair to the tennis court three to six months, so it's pretty amazing.

And Don Ho, anybody know who Don Ho is.

?

He was famous in the sixties for that song and he's 72 years old who lives in Hawaii, had open heart surgery last year, and it didn't work.

Plus he got a pacemaker, wasn't working.

So, he went to Bangkok and had this done and seven weeks later he was doing full sets back to work.

So, that put them on the map.

So, they're making money with it.

And everybody told them, no you're gonna need $32 million - $50 million for this kind of a starter company, and it would take you five years before you would get any money.

And they did it with $3 million for two years.

Smart people, and they're on the diet.

[Attendee #2]

I was listening to public radio and it looks like SA Institute and a bunch of others that could have a consortium, other company, and they're gonna start this big stem cell research thing in San Diego.

They're all excited about it.

[Attendee]

They're doing different stems cells aren't they.

They're not doing blood stem cells are they?

[Attendee #2]

I'm not sure?

[Aajonus]

Well, the problem with the fetus stem cells is they were rejected something like 60% of the case just like having a transplant problem there.

But when you have your own stem cells from your own blood and you're breeding your own blood stem cells, there's no rejections, no side effects.

They're very happy with that.

What the health centers are going to do is they're gonna provide the Primal Diet food completely.

We're gonna have 100 acres on each one.

One in Thailand, one in Costa Rica.

So, we'll be growing all our own food, herbs, everything year round because the areas I'm picking are tropical enough to grow all year round, all the food.

[Attendee]

Including the meat.

[Aajonus]

Oh yeah?

We'll have cattle, we'll have dairy, we'll have everything.

The farm that my grandparents had was only 50 acres of growing and barns and we about 40 Jersey cow, which supplied all the milk from just about 10 miles west of Chicago all the way to Peoria.

It supplied all the milk for all the towns round all through the early 1900s, late 1800s.

And plus that was 40 acres of corn that we grew to feed the horses cause they Clydesdale horses to pull the wagons to deliver the milk.

Of course in the 20s they had the delivery trucks, classical things to start delivering it.

But my grandfather, he liked to stick with the horses and the buggy.

He did it all the way up to the 30s with the horse buggy or he didn't get out there himself, helped do it, but it was all milked by hand.

He never went to machine all the way up.

It was about 49 when he stopped producing dairy.

[Attendee]

Did you grow up on raw milk.

[Aajonus]

I was born in 47, they started boiling it?

My grandparents bought the bull.

It was all boiled.

She would boil it right there on the stove.

I don't think she did it with all the cream, she cuts on the cream off, so we're getting cream with our cereals, berries.

She had a great raspberry garden.

So, at these primal centers, the diet will be 100% available every day, day and night.

There will be lots of hydrotherapy, outdoor hot baths.

The land that I've chosen, 60% of the land is bordered by Elk River, so we'll be able to use hydro and solar power, should be completely self-sustainable.

The river has a great deal of red clay, so we do like they do in Vietnam at one of the spas there, siphon the clay mud into these tubs where people can sit in a warm clay and stay in there for- in Vietnam at that particular spa, they only lets you stay in for 20 minutes.

I would like people to stay in it for an hour - hour and a half, especially if they have lymphatic damage.

And then there'll be swimming pools and there'll be kitchens where people get to learn how to make primal food, how prepare dishes, and lots of therapists, massage therapists.

Anything that I know that has worked.

[Attendee]

With Chlorine.

[Aajonus]

No, no, no?

It will be an electrical chlorinator.

So, you just put real sun dried sea salt in the water and the electric coordinator turns it into a non-toxic chlorine with no chloroform vapors.

It's called an electrical coordinator, made for pools.

And they're relatively inexpensive.

[Attendee]

Yeah, they do them in New Zealand everywhere.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

So, I've got friends in Nevada City who have it for their very natural looking swimming pool, I swim there every time.

One time they put too much salt in, it was like swimming in the ocean.

I didn't like that, but that was only once they did that.

I think they went to pour it in and sack broke or something, got too much salt in there.

[Attendee]

Is there any place that you would go here locally to just swim.

Any type of any kind of spa?

[Aajonus]

Nothing, there really isn't?

Well, the closest thing, it's not that far from here is Deep Creek.

That's in Hesperia, just on the other side of the San Bernardino Mountains.

You go 15 through San Bernardino and you get off at Hesperia and then you ask for- well, you might be able to find directions on the internet to the Bolin Ranch field, and it's about 25 miles east from Hesperia.

And you go to the Bolin Ranch and you pay like $4 for your car, and then you drive in about half a mile and you park your car and you walk two miles into the canyons mountains and follow the trail down and the river from all the melting rain and you snow from the mountains flows down and you get a river.

So, you gotta cross the river and the river's probably from here to the sidewalk over there wide and it never gets any higher than this.

Well, it does when the rains first melt, you can get this high and it's pretty cold.

You cross the river cold as hell and you get to the other side and there are all these natural hot springs that are coming out of the mountains and all these natural pools, and there are about five of them.

It's all hot springs, so you get to go and they're all places to dive off of these rocks into the cold.

So, you go from the hot to the coal and you get to swim around.

Men, wear some drawers or something, or keep your penis protected because there are catfish in there and they bite.

I got a bad bite once, immediately bled because catfish have teeth.

[Attendee]

Should ate him.

[Aajonus]

Laurie did.

This is wild.

If you want to spend the night there, it's illegal.

Don't do it on a weekend because the Rangers come in on horseback and they'll ticket you at $80 and they tell you you have to leave, but $80 is like a good hotel.

I've never gotten bused for renting night there during the week, but a lot of people get run off on the weekend.

Too crowded on the weekend.

It's San Bernardino State Park.

[Attendee]

We have lots of hot springs down there.

[Aajonus],[unclear 18:45 if u wanna try and hear it]

And then this place has one, it's called, , and it's right there.

I mean, if you broke the rocks off, the cold water and the hot water would be running together, same level.

And they've got a very deep one where you have to climb a little bit and it's probably about 8 feet deep.

.

And then one's up on top, really hot, very hot.

[Attendee]

Did you drink the formula before you go into the bath.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, absolutely?

[Attendee]

And then afterwards you need exercises.

[Attendee]

Well, on that side you've got a trail that leads all the way down to the dam, which is about 12 miles?

So you've got plenty of trail, they're fire roads.

That's a fire road.

It's a very easy walk and that's pretty flat.

Not like when you come in from Bolin Ranch, you don't wanna walk 12 miles, you just wanna walk two miles.

That is mostly downhill, on the way back it's uphill.

Better make sure you have enough food for as many days as you're gonna get back there cause you're gonna need your fuel to get back.

(22) Hair Greying From Toxins
gray hair detox hair

(23) Mercury In Fish
[2006],[Aajonus]

Each of the animals, like we had like five times in that 24-hour period, and then three days after we had examined everything

And the amount of mercury that was in the fish before cooked and everything, just the concentration of different parts of the tissue, was all put together and divided and then equally that was shared among all the animals in that 24 hour period.

And then the feces and urine was collected to measure the amount of mercury in the feces and urine.

And in the ones who ate it raw, it was 96% - 98% discharge from the urine and feces.

The fat molecules that held the mercury in suspension were relatively undigested.

So, the body can identify and pass it right through.

But then the animals who ate the cooked swordfish, only 8% came out, at worst than 12%.

So, 8% - 12%.

Only 8% - 12% came out of their bodies.

So, all that rest of that mercury was poisoning.

As long as you eat the fish raw, you're not gonna get, probably that other 4% to 8% was discharged through perspiration and right out through the skin.

And that's all common sense that that.

So, there was no evidence that stored the body when you eat it raw, lots of evidence against of it stored.

Of course, we didn't scrape the skin to find out cause the cats and dogs had too much hair.

(24) Organic Eggs, Where To Get Eggs
[2006],[Aajonus]

It's like calling all of these eggs organic, organic, organic

These eggs aren't organic, 75% - 80% of the feed is soy and even though it was raised organically, you can't feed raw soy to a chicken.

It has to be heat processed and chemically treated.

Once you do that, the soy that you're feeding the chicken is no longer organic, nor is it anywhere natural.

It's all a life.

, it's an absolute fraud.

[Attendee]

Where do you get eggs then.

[Aajonus]

I get Lilies eggs and they raise out on the land eating bugs and stuff like that, and she feeds them very little soy?

[Attendee]

So, what should I ask for when I'm on the East coast when I'm looking for eggs.

[Aajonus]

Well, just try to find chickens that have been running out on pasture?

[Attendee #2],[Question about the eggs at Rawsome that were regular garbage eggs labeled as organic sold to the food club],[Aajonus]

The results were decreased tremendously.

In fact, they were getting sicker.

Some of the cancer clients that were eating it progressed rapidly into more cancer and the literature out there on the internet, if you wanna look up soy is tremendous.

The amount of laboratory animals that get cancer by eating isoflavones.

Cause it's high in isoflavones, especially when they're isolated and treated like that.

Cause a human has to have it treated too and cleaned with chemicals cuz it would kill us if we, ate it raw.

So, the same way we treat the chickens is the same way they treat them for us.

The isoflavones are very isolated and they're free radical basically and all animals that are fed, the cancer rate increases like 36%.

It's an astounding amount.

(25) Plaque and Toxins Go Into Brain
[2006],[Attendee]

So much more plaque

[Aajonus]

Most of your toxic metals are in the brain.

The brain is 60% fat, it's higher than any other place in the body except for the bone marrow and most of the toxins go into the bone marrow and brain.

The body tries to defend the bone marrow and restrict poisons going there cuz that's where you breed with red, white blood cells and stem cells.

So, the brain is the most polluted part of the body.

We also have the 80,000 years ago is when we started developing such a large brain and that coincides with the amount of cooking that had been done and starting to melt and use pottery and stuff like that where they were using kilns where you've got this poisonous vapor with heavy metals breathing into your lungs.

So, the brain seemed to develop under the amount of pollution that that man was subjecting himself to .

(26) Saltwater
(27) Skin Brushing
[2006],[Aajonus]

It's awful

When I've looked at skin brushings under a microscope, it just lacerates new skin.

So, what you've done is created a scar or tissue of the new skin.

So, it's always best to use cotton or silk wash cloth.

And after you've got all that dead skin very moist, you can just rub it off and then you're taking care of that new skin.

But you put a brush on there, even the natural bristles, just cause scratching.

Just like if you had a rash and you were scratching yourself and you created all this very light scab all over does.

[Attendee]

But the old dry skin does come up with it though, don't you agree.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but it damages the new skin?

So, it's slightly hardened and scarred and that's affects the next generation that's bred.

It also impedes that generation from reproducing itself.

Silk cloth.

Your raw silk.

I know some people in Tibet, and they use wool wash cloth.

Little rough, but it doesn't cause scratches.

(28) Sunabthing and Coconut Oil
[2006],[Attendee]

What about when you lie in the sun then

Cause I'm thinking about that, when you lie in the sun you sit just like you do in a sauna,?

[Aajonus]

But you don't have that hot heat.

[Attendee]

Oh, I dunno about that here in San Diego.

[Aajonus]

It's not 168°.

The lowest area I measured, probably not my own cause I don't have one.

But when I've gone to Ivy Hot Springs, I've gone to Murrieta Hot Springs, all these places and gyms that I've gone to, all those, when I've measured the different layers in the sauna.

The highest one I ever was in was 186° at the top.

[Attendee]

But if you lie down.

[Aajonus]

And then as you go down, It decreased, the lowest was 120°.

That's hot.

[Attendee]

But what about you lying in the sun though.

[Aajonus]

You're not gonna get over 100°?

[Attendee]

It feels the same temperature.

I understand what you're saying.

[Aajonus]

It feels hot.

[Attendee]

It feels very hot.

[Aajonus]

Because you got metals, like you have a car, you go out and touch a car with a dark paint job, it's gonna be really hot.

If it's a light colored car, it's not gonna be as hot.

And when you've got heavy metals coming out: lead, mercury, any of those, they absorb the sun and they become very hot.

[Attendee]

That's all right in the sun.

[Aajonus]

It'll be okay, it's going to be hot on your body?

And it's going to burn the cells, but it's not gonna bake into your skin.

[Attendee]

Because I do a lot of that in the summer and I thought that might be bad.

[Aajonus]

No, but you can rinse those off so you won't burn so much from the sun.

And also, if you put the coconut oil.

[Attendee]

I put the lubricating, I always put your lubrication formula.

[Aajonus]

Put the coconut oil on, now that we have the coconut oil and when it comes out, it has to go through a layer of oil to get to your skin and it's not going to happen and you can rinse yourself off too and it won't because it'll be cooler water, it's not gonna rinse off the oil.

It's only gonna rinse off the metals.

[Attendee]

I'm at the beach, is that bad.

[Aajonus]

Well, the salt water will wash off the oils?

[Attendee]

Yeah, I put it on again.

Yeah.

And I'm just trying to get it straight now.

Even though I hear what you say, I feel hotter in the sun than I would in the sauna.

[Aajonus]

Well, that's all because of the metal refractory.
