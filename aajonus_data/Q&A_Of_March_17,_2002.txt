(1) Almonds Hard To Digest and Sprouts Are Vegetables
[2005],[Aajonus]

If you have that you don't want pine nuts

[Attendee]   No almonds.

[Aajonus]   No, almonds are very difficult to digest?

[Attendee]   Even if you soak them, if you soak them.

[Aajonus]   If you soak them, you've turned them into a vegetable?

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   And what if you sprout-

Cellulose, same thing.

They're a vegetable.

Once it's a sprout, it's a vegetable, but then you still have some enzyme and inhibitors in sprouts.

[Attendee]   What if you soak them in whey from when you make your cheese.

[Aajonus]   I've not experimented with that?

It's a possibility, I don't know that the lactic acid will incapacitate the enzyme inhibitors, the protein inhibitors, cuz they're pretty strong.

I would have to do a test and see.

[Attendee]   Because aren't there a lot of the enzyme inhibitors in the walnuts.

[Aajonus]   Well, like I say, they're in there, but I found that if I make that combination of the eggs, fat and the honey with it it neutralizes?

[Attendee #2]   Does it make a difference if you soak the almonds in pineapple juice.

Is that?

[Aajonus]   That'll cause most people gas, you're talking about high sugar food?

Even though it has lots of acids in it, like the bromalin that will help break down the nuts to some extent, the high sugar in reaction with that particular kind of fat and high carbohydrate will cause indigestion, and gas in a lot of people, most people.

I've never met anybody who could do it without farting all day long.

[Attendee #2]   I would like to make a testimonial.

I'm not farting since I'm on your diet.

I just want everybody to know that.

[Aajonus]   Most people don't.

Most people are gas free.

.

(2) Almonds Soaked In Pineapples
[2005],[Aajonus]

Neurological toxins, including hormones that have stored in the body from trauma

[Attendee]

That's pretty cool.

[Aajonus]

And everybody detoxes trauma hormones and you might go into that.

Oh, I hate this guy because you had an incident with the guy before your father beat the shit out of you one time, and that neurological compound comes up.

All of a sudden, you're looking at some other man in your life and you're saying, I hate you you bastard.

It's got nothing to do with him.

[Attendee]

Poor guy.

[Aajonus]

Exactly.

[Attendee]

So nuts.

Like there's something there, nuts and you know, like crazy nuts.

.

(3) Bone, Cartilage, Tendons, Neurological Tissue
Intestinal neurological

Bone cartilage, connected tissue, tendons, um, glands that are white and all neurological tissue, um, are, are healed quicker by the ingestion of foul.

Any white meat, um, with some fish is the white niche.

Mm-hmm but mainly foul rabbits, but we can't get them unless they've been fed off of pellets.

Okay.

Do you have questions.

She's just listening?

No question, Kimberly.

Not yet.

Okay.

Do you have questions.

What is your name?

My name's Mike?

Mike.

Hi Mike.

Who kills the town.

Um, well it depends, uh, you know, who's, who's, who's made it is and?

.

(4) Bread and Butter Is Bad, Binds With Neurological Hormones
[2005],[Attendee]

When you mentioned eating bread better in your book, was that before you kind of looked into the carbohydrates or is it okay to have some starch

[Aajonus]   Well, you know, when I read that research and then I started doing some experiments with it, it was always a trade off with a cooked starch?

You know, it's poisonous, there are byproducts in it.

We're not going to handle it properly.

We'll have to use tremendous amounts of nutrients to discard all of the waste and toxins that are involved in it, but I couldn't find any other starch that chelated with neurological toxins.

Anytime you have trauma or an upset in your life, there are hormones that are produced in the neurological system that are just like any other poison in the system, they will store and have to be detoxified.

If you wanna know the particulars about that you can go on the internet and look for The Biology of Emotions by El Nora van Winkle.

She was a biochemist that worked on neurological compounds for about 40 some years in New York city Medical University.

[Attendee #2]   What was her name again.

[Aajonus]   ‚Å†Elnora van Winkle, Biology of Emotions?

She has the complex medical paper, and then a layman's paper for the average person to understand so you can read both or.

And she explains that when she was doing the tests and researching, she found neurological hormones that related to trauma, and they categorized them and differentiated them.

And she found that people, when they go through an emotional upset that has no relationship to reality, that they're detoxing.

.

.

.

(5) Celery
[2005],[Aajonus]

I like the celery because it isn't extreme and it keeps the salt level

So, it's like a constant IV sodium level in the body.

It helps stimulate the adrenals and everybody needs some adrenaline, keep active and a lot of people who've been eating cooked foods for so long, have had lots of salt storages in their body and the high celery content helps detoxify that.

.

(6) Cheese With Vegetable Juice Bad
[2005],[Aajonus]

Cream and butter

[Attendee]   No cheese.

[Aajonus]   You don't want to have cheese well, you can have cheese if you're getting nauseous, it's a sign you should have cheese, but cheese doesn't digest well because it's very acid, and then you mixed it with the alkaline juice?

If you have the alkaline, and the acids together, neither will digest properly.

So, you're not going to digest as much juice if you have cheese with it.

However, some people are so poisoned and get nauseous right away that they have to have cheese with their juice.

But normally, no.

[Attendee]   What does the avocado do.

what are the properties of the fat?

[Aajonus]   Well, that's a different question from the juice?

You can save that for that particular subject.

[Attendee]   I rarely have time to make juice, so I but either this Essential Greens, or The Juice Evolution.

I'm wondering that, or just going to Jamba Juice and they'll make celery and parsley.

They won't make squash.

They'll make cucumber.

Should I.

[Aajonus]   Well, cucumbers a squash, summer squash?

[Attendee]   Oh, okay.

Oh, so would that be preferable over buying the juice evolution if I can have fresh made.

It's not organic either?

[Aajonus]   Um, yeah, it's better than having nothing because that's the only place we get our vitamin enzymes and mineral supplement, from the juice.

[Attendee]   Yeah, but I'm saying to choose between the juice evolution or the one that they would make.

[Aajonus]   I would have both.

[Attendee]   Yeah, the juice is really great.

When I make it it's noticeably superior.

[Aajonus]   Incredible.

Yes.

Rich and alive.

If you make it every once every three days.

It's not that difficult.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   I try, I just literally don't-

Get a high school kid to come over and do it.

It's so easy.

Just put up on the bulletin board, every three days, pay you 20 bucks.

.

(7) Chicken Vs Fish Heals Tendons
[2005],[Aajonus]

Well, you're likely to get to a acidic after a while and maybe get a little irritable, maybe get depressed

[Attendee]

So, the way to balance that is.

.

.

[Aajonus]

Eat fish with it.

Eat more chicken and fish.

[Attendee]

I have a hard time eating the fish raw.

[Aajonus]

Marinate it, lemon or lime.

Let it sit for a couple of days in lemon or lime juice and it'll just soften just like it's cooked.

It won't be cooked in that way.

You know, just like your hydrochloric acid dissolves the substances so that you can separate it, fractionate it, use the parts.

Well, the lemon just does that for you ahead of time.

Just easier to eat.

It's much more palatable.

[Attendee]

And, uh, I've been doing.

Since I saw it, that's almost too much.

I don't really know the information really.

I'm still doing it.

I dunno if I should keep doing it, or what do you think.

[Aajonus]

Is your shoulder better?

[Attendee]

Um, still inflamed?

[Aajonus],[Attendee]

Uhuh, then I would up to a cup, you said at a half a cup

And there was no time limit on it.

[Aajonus]

You do it until it heals?

Did you have surgery on that.

[Attendee]

Yes?

[Aajonus]

Okay.

It's likely they put Mercurochrome, which is mercury or merthiolate or some kind of iodine.

They rub it on there as an antiseptic, and what that does is poison the tissue.

So, until that is removed, proper healing may not take place without adhesions for up to 5 years.

No, I'm saying that if you don't do something properly it could last that long or even longer.

Some people it could stay in there for a lifetime if they're not eating proper foods, but let's say.

.

.

The reason I tell people to have green cabbage juice is because of the high vitamin K and vitamin U.

It allows proper blood clotting so that an area can heal properly.

But if you've got mercury or iodine in that area preventing new cells from regenerating, and aiding the area for healing, then the cabbage juice is going to help to an extent, but it's not going to change the tissue structure.

.

(8) Chinese And Egpytian Royalty Only Ate Meat
[2005],[Aajonus]

Um, from my understanding of research of history of the Asian cultures the royalty, the dynasties only ate meats and fat

They kept the lackies eating half or more carbohydrates like grains to keep them emotionally imbalanced because high carbohydrate causes a sugar problem in the body.

And you can't keep up with that much advanced glycation end products.

So, what they found was that emotionally they were unstable, and they would never overthrow the hierarchy and the Egyptians did it also.

[Attendee]   Yeah, I was gonna say also more passive at the same time.

[Aajonus]   No, actually it makes them more irritable and violent.

[Attendee]   So rice, you don't think creates passivity.

[Aajonus]   No?

.

(9) Cilantro Only 10% For Metal Detox and Cream
[2005],[Attendee]

I'm just wondering if there are other things on the diet that are designed to attract metals as well

[Aajonus]   Cilantro is good for that.

No more than 10% of the juice, but cilantro can do it very radically, and if you've got a lot of mercury coming out of your system or lead.

You might get very fatigued, very poisoned, very nasty.

Your mate won't like you very much if you can't handle it.

And if you're using a metal extractor like that, it's always good to have either some raw cows' cream or some coconut cream with it, so that as soon as the metals come into the blood, you'll have fat there to arrest it.

People who drink the juice and have heart palpitations afterwards or speedy heart.

That's a sign that the metals have gotten into your blood, and you don't have the available blood fats to bind with it.

So, the heart palpitations, don't let it frighten you, you just need to sit down, but if you're going to do that, then the first juice, if you have that side effect, then every juice in the morning should have some cream in it, so that, that doesn't happen.

[Atendee #2]   Can you eat butter just after it.

[Aajonus]   Instead of two tablespoons of cream or more, you could use one tablespoon of butter?

[Atendee #2]   Avocado.

[Aajonus]   Avocado won't work for that?

Coconut cream, raw.

.

.

.

(10) Concentrations Of Magnesium and Calcium
[2005],[Aajonus]

Like one of the highest concentrations of calcium and the magnesium is in meat

It's most assemilable.

Juice is okay in that area, but not as concentrated with meat, because for some reason, magnesium and calcium is better utilized in a concentration of fat that is animal based and protein.

So, almost all of the minerals in meat, as long as the meat's not dehydrated or not cooked, 100% of the minerals can be utilized in cell tissue.

And when you're eating raw foods like raw meats, you need very little calcium.

Once you heat a food, you cauterized the minerals.

That's like taking clay, which is normally malleable.

Once you fire it, it is pottery.

You cannot grow mold in it or plants in it anymore.

It is dead, and that's the same thing with happens when you cook food.

You cauterized the minerals, the calcium rate of absorption is like down to 12%, 10 to 12% can be somewhat properly utilized.

That means a loss of 88% of the calcium from cooking the meat.

So, all this calcium loss is not because the soils are deficient it's because we're damaging the nutrients before we put 'em into our body and we can't utilize them.

.

(11) Cultures That Eat Grains
[2005],[Attendee]

I mean, some healthy cultures ate grains

Can we do that now, is it different than when they did that.

[Aajonus]

Her question was, there are cultures that seem to be able to thrive by eating grains?

[Attendee]

I meant partly grains in combination, they could have it in their diet, right.

[Aajonus]

The cultures who eat strictly grains are the unhealthiest cultures in the world?

They're third world countries, you can see the children and their distended stomachs and their bones with extended stomachs.

Those are cultures that only eat grain.

It's a very malnourished culture.

Those who mix like the Japanese and Chinese, uh, and eat lots of grains still is not a healthy thing because the human body can only handle about 7 - 8% advanced glycation end products.

.

(12) Ecoli Prevents Tumors
[2005],[Aajonus]

In two to seven days

University of Toronto has been using the Verotoxin produced by E coli to completely dissolve human brain tumors in 2 to 7 days, including the vessels going to the tumor.

And they're telling us to to worry about E coli.

I beg your pardon.

That's a cancer preventative?

All animals eat fecal matter, except humans.

I mean, civilized humans.

[Attendee]

Do you need to eat it on this diet.

[Aajonus]

Well, I do recommend it for people who have terminal cancer, and I've seen it turn it around?

I've seen so many people go downhill and now if I can talk to them into eating some fecal matter.

Turn it around.

Turns around like crazy.

.

(13) Eggs Pull Poisons To The Stomach & Vomiting
[2005],[Aajonus]

Good! You should vomit

[Attendee]   Well, what's the point of eating it then if I just chuck it up.

[Aajonus]   You've seen those old labels, and remember when we were kids, it said if you swallow this poison, swallow an egg and induce vomiting.

Because eggs are great to pull poisons to the stomach like milk is, but eggs is pretty profound in doing it and it will cause you to vomit, but once you vomited, you got rid of it and then you can keep down the eggs, but you've gotta let yourself vomit if it's trying to.

But usually, you only vomit like once and then you'll be able to eat for days, eat a lot of eggs, but vomiting is the quickest way to get rid of poisons.

You don't have to worry about diarrhea.

You don't have to worry about loss of fluids, discharging the bile and the poisons easily.

[Attendee]   Saves you a trip to the toilet.

[Aajonus]   Laughs, yes.

It also saves a lot of nutrients lost trying to keep it from destroying intestinal tissue as it passes out.

.

(14) Fireplaces Polymers
[2005],[Attendee]

Well, this isn't really having anything to do with food, but I was wondering about like fireplaces and stuff like that

If you're burning logs, and papers if that's gives off like toxic.

[Aajonus]

It gives off a lot of carbon monoxide depending upon what you're burning?

[unclear] there's heavy oils and there's a lot more tars as well as the carbon monoxide.

Chimney area should have a glass in front of it and have good circulation, so the smoke and gas doesn't come into the house.

And most of the lawns are the firewood that they own.

[Aajonus]

A lot of them are treated.

[Attendee #2]

What are they treated with.

[Aajonus]

They treat it with substances, dried out, some kind of solvent?

[Attendee]

And they don't necessarily have to say that.

Like they don't- obviously it's all green?

[Aajonus]

No, you're not eating it.

So yeah, no restrictions.

.

(15) Goat Milk With BLood
[2005],[Aajonus]

And who's butchering, when I can

I do.

And how do you do well, what I did on Pangai last year, I butchered a goat.

So, what I did was made a harness for him and spun him from the tree until he went to sleep, and then I slit his jugular vein and caught the blood and put it in equal parts goats' milk and blood, and that tasted like milkshake.

Believe it or not.

We had five vegetarians there and 15 of us were raw animal meat eaters and the five vegetarians were so taken by the ceremony that we had cause we had drummers and we had two spinners to spin the animal around in the harness, hanging from the tree.

And then I did a, kind of a hypnotic thing with the animal, so you go to sleep faster and they were very impressed by that.

So, we had two-gallon jars full, equal parts of blood and goat milk and passed it around for everybody had a little bit.

There was all these vegetarians going impression, they just wanted to be part of it, but they just hint about it.

And every one of them, all of us, even, I was a little reluctant and it tasted like ice cream.

It didn't have any relationship to what blood tastes like by itself.

And it was just like ice cream.

It was so rich.

And with all these vegetarians, just going gulp, gulp, gulp like that.

Those two gallons of milk and blood were gone in 15 minutes.

And we only had 19 people, 20 minutes, all of two gallons of milk blood were gone.

It's amazing.

It's wonderful.

But you know, everything gets killed.

You kill vegetables, you kill anything you eat, right.

[Attendee]   If somebody wants to eat a strict vegetarian, can they still benefit from your diet.

[Aajonus]   Well, my diet isn't a vegetarian diet, but if somebody wants to eat a lot of fats, then they will definitely be helped?

[Attendee]   Including the dairy and the eggs.

[Aajonus]   The people who don't eat the meat won't regenerate.

.

(16) Honey and INfants
[2005],[Attendee]

Hamburger

I was doing really well eating hamburger for a while, and the last week or two I had to like gag it down and so I tried to go to a different kind of meat  Do you have any suggestions for helping with that.

[Aajonus]   How were you trying to eat it?

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   I was eating it with just butter and honey

Butter and honey?

That may detoxify the liver or spleen or gallbladder too quickly, and that may cause some nausea because when you put that combination like that, and the meat's almost in a pate, it's absorbed very readily, and it can cause instant detox.

So, when the body can detox, it'll dump into the stomach first and there's your nausea.

So, if you eat some cheese with it, it'll probably prevent that.

But you might want to eat some cheeses first, so it's already in your stomach and ready to absorb the toxins so you don't feel repulsed or don't have to experience the nausea and also tomatoes help relax that kind of a detoxification.

So, you might make a sauce with butter and tomato.

[Attendee]   So, what would a sauce with butter and tomato.

How would you do that?

Just butter, and tomato?

[Aajonus]   Room temperature butter, room temperature tomatoes, they'll blend very well, even cheese?

Yeah, in the blender, one of those little jars.

Add a little tomato, red onion.

Ingredients.

.

.

tomato

butter

cheese

red onion

.

(17) Honey Butter Pate Nasuea = Eat Cheese
[2005]   Question about honey and infants

They say not to feed them honey.

[Aajonus]   Well, there are several reasons that they don't like to feed honey to infants.

Most honey's heated to high temperatures.

So, when the bee collects the nectar, swallows it, and he manufactures an insulin like substance, it converts the nectar into honey.

Then he gets back to the hive, they vomit it.

So, honey is bee puke.

Basically, is what it is, but it has an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carbohydrate in it into enzymes for digesting, utilizing, and assembling proteins and only 10% sugar.

Once you heat it up to 100¬∞, between 93¬∞ and 100¬∞ degrees, you alter and destroy that insulin-like substance.

So, then it's back into sugar.

It's not a radical sugar until you take it over 104¬∞ and most honeys are heated at minimum of 118¬∞.

So, if an infant has that they'll have a sugar problem, it could cause anaphylaxis.

Also, they worry about bacteria in honey, which is the most absurd thing because bacteria cannot thrive in honey  In fact, they say that these, the people who've done the testing experiments have said that it's absolutely impossible to get bacteria to thrive and even sustain itself in honey.

So, it's the anaphylactic children/infants will have from the high sugar of heated honeys, but it doesn't happen with unheated honeys.

Unheated below 93¬∞.

.

(18) Honey Can Cause Detox
[2005],[Aajonus]

Whatever you like to spice it up

Also having the honey with it may cause too much detoxification if you're having it too often.

So, you might want to cut back on the honey with your meat meal for a while, and just skip it sometimes.

[Attendee]   What kind of ratio would you suggest, would you say a few cherry tomatoes with three tablespoons of butter.

[Aajonus]   It doesn't matter how many tomatoes you eat as long as you are still have room for your meat.

You can have as many as you like, as long as it doesn't spoil your appetite.

In fact, usually let's say you had a handful of cherry tomatoes with a half a pound of meat.

It's easier to eat the half a pound of meat with the handful of cherry tomatoes than it is to get to meat down by itself.

.

(19) Honey Must Be Under 93 Deg
[2005],[Aajonus]

Unheated, honey, yeah

Only 10% will be used as sugar.

[Attendee]

So, what's the other 90%.

[Aajonus]

Enzymes for digesting, utilizing, and assimilating protein?

.

(20) How Long Without Juice
[2005],[Aajonus]

You know, eating meat on a daily basis

I can go more no more than let's say 4 days without juice, and I start breaking out as you see.

I've gone four days without juice.

I'm starting to break out instantly on the fourth day, but that's cause I had a vagotomy, which means they severed all the vagus nerve to my stomach.

So, acids still refluxes into my mouth.

For me, I still have to have juices frequently.

And most people, especially starting the diet are gonna be highly acidic because when they detox, the poisons get into the blood and of course they get into the tissues.

If you have the vegetable juice there, it'll alkalinize that, it'll have lots of alkalinizing minerals to bind with those poisons, and then the end result will still be alkalinity, instead of acidity.

.

(21) How To Get Rid Of Anger
[2005],[Aajonus]

These hormones

She was a person who believed in primal therapy, which means you scream, you rant, you rave, and you kick pillows.

You beat things to death, except for humans.

But when I used to exercise primal therapy, It only continued the rage.

So, I decided to do the opposite.

Whenever I felt rage, I would go paint or smell flowers, or do gardening, sing, do everything that was pretty and nice rather than violent.

And I found that I was able to change myself that way.

So, she and I had quite a disagreement, but she was still in her anger.

She did my diet for about two years and then thought that instincto was better.

And instinctive means you eat what's attracted to you, and she was 70 years old at the time.

.

(22) Humans Can Only Handle 8% AGES and Store 70%
[2005],[Aajonus]

Concentrations of byproduct of advanced glycation end product

Anytime the body uses glycogen as fuel, there's a byproduct called advanced glycation end product, and Columbia University in New York city did the research on it for about 28 years, 28 to 30 years, and found that in a healthy body, it stores at a rate 70% every time you eat a carb.

That means it stays in your body to your lifetime, 70% of that toxicity.

if you're unhealthy, like somebody with a compromised kidney or diabetes, it stores the rate of 90% or more.

That is a sugar product that actually melts tissue when it becomes so concentrated.

Like Coca-Cola.

So, that's why a flesh in muscle starts sagging, cause it fills up and starts melting the tissues.

That cannot be removed.

We are humans that have just lived that way.

.

(23) Milk and Lactobacillus
[2005],[Aajonus]

Their marketing tool

It has nothing to do with the human body.

[Attendee]   So, we didn't really have that in there.

[Aajonus],[unclear]   Well, there's lactobacillus, acidophilus, and bulgaricus in raw milk?

That's what raw milk is for, it's to get the bacterial environment going in animal.

That's what milk is for.

I use milk because I found that it relaxes a toxic system that is so toxic as a human from eating so much cooked food and all the pollution.

When I try to not use dairy, people have much more difficulty with relaxation, ease of diet.

It's difficult to get rid of their cravings.

It's much more difficult.

Milk.

Raw milk is just like a drug, it's very helpful.

.

(24) Milk Draws Poisons
[2005],[Aajonus]

Let's say a scorpion bite or a tarantula bite or a snake bite

It was poisonous.

If they had a lactating animal, they raised goats, they had goats' milk.

If they had a lactating animal, they would drink the milk rather than cut and suck because the milk will draw the poison to the stomach and then they vomit.

It worked so easily.

It was miraculous.

[Attendee]   How much would you drink.

[Aajonus]   They'd drank about a cup?

[Attendee]   Oh, really.

That little?

[Aajonus]   Yeah.

[Attendee]   Is that because of the cream.

Do you need to have both the milk, and the cream?

[Aajonus]   The cream will work to bring the poisons to the stomach?

It has to do with the combination of the lactic acids and the sugars and the proteins and the fats all together.

.

(25) Minerals From Cheese & Vegetable Juice
[2005],[Aajonus]

For any purpose because it's bioactive

Minerals from cheese cannot be utilized that way because once it's dried and cultured, it is a good detoxifier.

It absorbs, but it really can't be absorbed into the cells easily because it's no longer a bio-actively electrolyte bound.

And electrolytes have to be present.

Ions have to be present within the nutrients in order for the cell to absorb it, each cell has one or two ions in it and that's its guts.

When it needs to eat, it'll attract a mineral as it passes in the blood serum.

And so, it opens and the one or two ions inside will attract the ions that are bound with that mineral and the mineral attached to a food nutrient, whether it's protein, H2O like sodium usually carries H2O, potassium may carry glycogen.

Whether the glycogen is made from pyruvate or carbohydrate.

Just different minerals will carry different nutrients with it.

So, when the cell wants to eat that it opens up and attracts it.

If the ions aren't active, there's no magnetic force.

So, it can't be utilized and absorb properly.

.

(26) Parsley
[2005],[Aajonus]

The parsley I use because of the high vitamin D in it, vitamin E and the high chlorophyll content, which helps people utilize oxygen better

And it's very good at alkalinizing the blood that becomes so acidic when you detox constantly.

[Attendee]

Isn't it high in zinc as well.

[Aajonus]

Depends upon where it's grown?

The thing that's highest in zinc is zucchini.

No matter what soil it's grown, that's why I use the zucchini to help pull out toxic metals.

All the summer squash help do that.

They've got a starch in them that has a tendency to attract metals.

[Attendee]

Are there different metals for different starches.

[Aajonus]

No, actually all of your summer squashes will attract any of them?

So will the winter squashes, but then you get a sugar high from all the high carbohydrate content and that's not good.

.

(27) Recommended Juicers, Oxygen Destroys Nutrients
[2005],[Attendee]

Well, directly from Tribest because they just had the show up in Anaheim

Until the end of this month, they're running them wholesale is about 340.

[Aajonus]

Oh, that's pretty good.

[Attendee #2]

Can you arrange them for us.

[Attendee]

I'm a distributor?

[Aajonus]

Give me your name and number because I send people to Ferns, and another place know that's even cheaper in Beverly Hills get cheaper.

380 something.

[Attendee #2]

We got Norwalk.

[Aajonus]

Well, Norwalk's have two processes and they're $2,600, something like that.

Ad they tri-trate, means they masticate, break it down, then you have to press it.

So, it touches oxygen twice.

So, the juice isn't as good and doesn't last as long.

And the green light, green power and green star, it's all pressed, it's crushed and pressed rather than tri-trated and pressed.

So, there's not a lot of oxygen that destroys it.

[Attendee #2]

What's the use of the magnet.

[Aajonus]

What it does is it frees up some of the minerals that's in the pulp and it goes with the juice, rather than staying in the pulp?

[Attendee #2]

I've also heard documents that it reduces the surface tension in the juice.

So, it's more permeable in the cells.

[Aajonus]

That's said that's the same thing I was saying, but you said it a different way.

.

(28) Starch & Nut Formula
[2005],[Aajonus]

So, I worked very hard at finding something I could use to substitute for that cooked starch with the raw fat to bind with those neurological toxins

Nuts was my best shot, but I couldn't get rid of the enzyme inhibitors that would prevent digestion of protein for 20-48 hours after eating the nuts, and that's not just the protein in the nuts.

That's the protein in any food you eat after that, whether it be eggs or, or meat it just wouldn't digest properly.

So, I started thinking about what could I neutralize these enzyme inhibitors with.

How could I inhibit the enzyme inhibitors, turn it right back on them?

So, I found that when I mixed- I mixed quite a few things to try to work it out, and finally, when I mixed eggs, honey, and a fat with it, whether it was butter, coconut cream, peanut oil, olive oil, some compound with it, some fat with it.

It worked and you only had to take it one day a week and it would work for the whole week.

So, I used the nut formula in combination.

The nut formula is nuts, egg, a fat and honey.

It has to be a lot of honey for.

[unclear] for some people who have a good liver, and pumpkin seeds for those few who have a good liver and sunflower seeds.

So, the easiest to digest are walnuts and pecans.

The next are pine nuts and sunflower seeds.

However, the pine nuts can cause intense glandular detoxification and nausea.

.

(29) Summer Squash
[2002],[Aajonus]

She asked if there was any time that the winter squashes would be good to eat

Yes.

You could have it up to 10% of your juices.

Like with carrot juice just to increase the vitamin a content.

[I'm not sure if he ever increased the carrot ratio]

.

(30) Three Grains Of Salt
[2005],[Aajonus]

Concentrate like salt in the blood

Let's say you have three little bitty grains of salt.

In a body about 5' 8'', about 140 pounds.

You will increase the concentration of sodium molecules in the blood to where they clump in about four to five in a clump.

So, what happens when the cell opens to eat H20.

It'll try to pull that sodium cluster into itself and it can't do it?

What happens is the magnetism is so great outside that it pulls the ions, which means it pulls the guts out of the cell and the cells can never eat anything again.

So, it shrivels like a raisin and dies.

And one little grain of salt will destroy 1 million red blood cells that way from clumping, clustering.

You won't even see it, it's about head of a pin but still you have a lot of it over and over 50, 60 years.

That's a lot of destroyed red blood cells.

[Frank],[Aajonus]   Is there any feedback as to whether it kills the cells that are basically supposed to die or that are weak, or does it do it-

Kill any one that opens to eat, whether it's healthy or not.

It's just like, if you have your mouth open and I'm passing around poison and you're the healthiest person here, guess what's gonna happen to you.

[Attendee #2]   Watch out, Frank?

(31) Too Much Fruit
(32) Vaccines Crippled Client, Vomit
[2005],[Aajonus]

Vaccines, and the thimerosal, which is mercury poisons the system

So, he's like this now imitation in a chair and he's 18 years old.

He's been that way since 18 months.

So, I've had him on a diet for about six weeks.

He's put on, 12 pounds for the first time in six years he'd put on weight.

And for the first time, since he was 18 months, His feet that were bound like that relaxed.

This kid was going to vomit.

I knew that cause if he got the mercury that went right to his nervous system like that and caused that kind of deformity then it's close to the surface.

He would be likely to vomit.

So I had to warn the parents that he's going to probably vomit profusely for an evening, and then he'll be able to eat for three days without vomiting anything, and then he may go into it again and like clockwork, that's the way it went.

First time he vomited all evening, and the next day he ate three pounds of meat the next day and the next day, and the next day.

For 10 days, he ate three pounds of meat a day and about 10 eggs, lots of milk.

This is a skinny kid that's only about 5' 8'' and 110 pounds, pretty thin.

So, eating all that food, very happy.

So, in just a matter of six weeks, he's improved probably by about 5% - 7%.

He hadn't improved anything since he was 18 months old.

So, the father and mother are pretty impressed.

The foods are incredible.

.

(33) Vegetable Juice Only 5% Herbs
[2005],[Attendee]

You generally give everybody the same parsley, celery, summer squash

So, it's like three or whatever juices and that's pretty much it as I understand it.

Why not- there's a zillion vegetables out there.

Why just those.

[Aajonus]

Because the others are more herbal, and they're stronger and they will have greater reactions?

For instance, let's say with Kimberly, I used a little bit of cauliflower and broccoli.

Now if you use too you use too much of that.

It'll make the thyroid slower, and that can cause lethargy tiredness, and some people need that just to slow them down.

So, I use others in small amounts and you can use any one you want, just know what it's for and no more than 5% of your juice.

[Attendee]

So is there a way to find out what they're for.

[Aajonus]

There are lots of verbal books around that have that in it?

[Attendee]

What about adding kale and other greens.

[Aajonus]

Like I said, no more than 5% because they're very concentrated?

If you are having that 4 times a day, you can be causing yourself to go quite a radical direction.

.

(34) Vegetables and Fiber Constipates
[2005],[Attendee]

There's cruciferous vegetables that are so healthy for you

That's a problem.

The cruciferous vegetables that are so healthy for you is a problem, And that's the problem.

I thought how can you go to work or anywhere if you are eating a lot of this or.

[Aajonus]   Well, we're not, we're not made to digest that.

They will cause gas.

What do you eat.

[Attendee]   What do you eat with it to counter the effect of it?

[Aajonus]   You don't, you have vegetable juice, vegetable juice is what you have, so you're not having whole vegetables?

Let's say you have a salad, you could eat some avocado with it, that would reduce the gas.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]   So, basically cause either whether it's cooked or not, it's the cauliflower, the broccoli, the-

They'll cause gas with or without being cooked.

We're not meant to digest them.

[Attendee]   The healthiest vegetables are the worst.

[Aajonus]   Right, but you can have them as juice, you don't need the fiber?

If you're an all-raw diet, meat diet.

You don't need any fiber.

Fiber is there for people who eat cooked foods because the foods have no vitamins and enzymes to properly digest.

Peristalsis is reduced by 2/3.

So, the food doesn't move it petrifies, especially meats when they're cooked.

So, what happens is you eat vegetables with it, to help get some vitamins and enzymes and broom it through.

But on a raw diet, whole vegetables will constipate you.

They'll create the opposite effect because what happens is, an herbivore has a digestive tract 2.

5x longer than ours.

They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to obtain fats and proteins.

They have 2 to 4 stomachs.

We have one.

So, what happens is we digest only a third of the vegetables, and that's mainly juice for the vitamins and enzymes and minerals.

So, what happens is by the time it gets down to the colon, it's still producing the alkalinity.

The bowel has to be entirely acid or the E coli won't feed on the fecal matter, and then we get constipated.

On a diet like this, like all carnivores, they don't eat fiber, yet they move all the time.

Unless they eat vegetables, feed them vegetables, it prevents the bacteria from feeding on the fecal matter and sponging it out.

A normal bowel movement for a human being should be 60% to 80% bacteria, mainly E coli.

That swells it up and sponges it, the byproducts of that are B vitamins and amino acids and the Verotoxin, which shrinks tumors.

.

(35) Vegetarians Don't Replicate Cells
[2005],[Aajonus]

The problem I find with vegetarians, especially long-term vegetarians is that they don't reproduce cells cause they don't get enough protein

So, what happens.

They hold onto dead cells?

So, they just go through life holding on to dead cells and not getting more alive.

[Attendee]   So how about the Indian populations that have been predominantly vegetarian.

[Aajonus]   Yeah, same thing for them?

I've seen it time after time.

They're more acclimated to it.

The tribes like the Fulani, and the Samburu mainly live on raw milk.

I mean, 90%.

of the Fulani is raw milk.

90% of their diet is raw milk, but because they've been on it for centuries it's fine for them.

They do have some skin discoloration that I find predominant in people who eat mainly raw milk, but there's no ill health associated with it.

.

(36) Weight Gain Lots Of Fat Vs Meat & Thin People
[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]

I'm eating about a container and a half of red meat, and I was having it twice a day, but to gain the weight-

You have to have lots of fat with your meat if you want to gain weight, otherwise you just gonna burn it

Let me give you an example.

I have a fellow who's on the diet's, been on the diet for 2 years, maybe a little over 2 years.

And he decided, he's doing well on the diet now, he was very thin before and gained about 40 pounds.

He's about 6' 2'', and he just decided he was ready to move to the next level.

So, he said, "I'd like to work out.

I'd like the bodybuild.

Is there something I can do.

" And I said, "Well, have a lubrication formula every time you eat meat or an equal amount of butter and some kind of sauce"?

So, at least 1/2 a cup - 3/4 of a cup of butter with each meat meal, this is a big guy.

In two and a half months, he put 6 inches on his chest and 4 inches on his arms and everybody accused him of using steroids.

So, you just have to add a lot of fat.

It has to be a lot of fat if you want build.

[Attendee]   I like the lube formula.

[Aajonus]   You can have as many as you like, just every time you eat meat have one, and then you put on more weight.

How long, how many pounds have you put on.

You put on what, about 7, 10?

[Attendee]   Yeah, that's it?

[Attendee #2]   Is it okay to have a lube formula whenever you feel hungry too.

[Aajonus]   No, well, it's good to have it once a day by itself if you want, but it's always good to have more protein?

You know, if you're gonna have lots of lube formulas you need lots of protein.

[Attendee #2]   So, that could detox.

[Aajonus]   It's just like anything?

If you have more carbohydrate or fats than you do protein, you're gonna become protein deficient.

If you have too many carbohydrates, you're going to de mineralize yourself.

You'll have tooth problems, bone problems, and just neurological pain.

Everything will increase that's painful will be exaggerated, increased.

And if you eat lots of fat, you'll feel better and all that, but you're not gonna put on massive muscle.

You're not gonna put on muscle mass.

You'll put on fat mass, which is good because it will protect you, and it binds.

All people who are fat, it's completely opposite from the medical profession.

All people who are fat are healthier than people who are thin, cuz people who are fat have storages of fat that bind with the poisons that are in their systems.

People who are thin, those poisons get into the tissue and damage the tissue.

And I used to think just the opposite, especially when I was a vegetarian.

Anybody who was fat was unhealthier than anybody who was bone thin.

And then when I started doing laboratory experiments and tests, I found that the tissue in people who were thin was highly contaminated.

They would injury easier, they were unhappier, they were more irritable.

There were all kinds of side effects.

Whereas the person who was fat usually had very few problems because they had the fat to down with the toxins.

[Attendee #2]   Fat and happy.

[Aajonus]   Fat and happy.

yeah.

So, I started getting fat as soon as I realized that.

Of course, I can't get very fat.
