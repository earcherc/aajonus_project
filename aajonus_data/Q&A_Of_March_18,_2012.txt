(1) A1 Vs A2 Milk Is Real, Dont Feed Rice Bran, Caused Bitter, Org Pastures
[2012],[Attendee]

What about this a1, a2 thing

[Aajonus]

Well, I haven't found anything in my experiments with people on this diet, haven't found any difference?

But when I'm living just on like two or three foods, I do notice the difference.

[Attendee]

Well, what's the a1 doing.

[Aajonus]

A1, I will have less energy from?

A2, I have more energy.

[Attendee #2]

What does that mean.

I don't know what A1 and A2 means?

[Aajonus]

It's a certain kind of genetic makeup that builds the milk.

There are certain chemicals that are produced in A2 cows that are not produced A1 cows?

Well, it's just because some cows have been crossbred and it's caused a problem.

Your jerseys, most of them are A2.

Holsteins are usually A1.

[Attendee #2]

What does Eli have.

[Aajonus]

He has both, but they're all moving to a A2's?

[Attendee #3]

What about that Organic Pastures milk.

[Aajonus]

I don't trust Mark as far as I can say?

There was a few years when he was feeding them organic rice bran.

You can't feed organic rice bran because once the brand has been processed with steam to get it off of the rice, it's processed and bran is not a complete food.

[Attendee #2]

I remember that.

It was awful a couple times.

[Aajonus]

Because you got gibberellic acid in the bran.

[Attendee #3]

What's that.

[Aajonus]

Gibberellic acid is an acid, it's a fatty acid?

It's an ester in the bran that causes swelling.

They extract it from rice bran to give to grapes and other plants to make them big and swollen.

But that causes swelling of the brain, swelling a lot of people's systems.

And it's really bitter and nasty tasting when the ester that are really bitter aren't removed and usually they remove them and it's even more toxic cause they use kerosene to do that.

So, when the gibberellic acid in the bran is digested by the cow, it doesn't break down that that bitter ester.

[Attendee #3],[Aajonus]

And so when you drink Organic Pasture's milk, your brain is-

They don't do it anymore.

I came down on on Mark pretty hard for it.

[Attendee #3]

And what's he been doing presently.

[Aajonus]

I don't know what he is doing?

That's why I say, I don't trust the man.

He was saying organic, organic, organic and he was feeding them non-organic substances for two years.

That was way back in 2003 and 2004.

[Attendee #3]

How long it take for something like that to go out of the animal system?

[Aajonus]

Well, out of the milk, it would take about 20, 25 days?

[Attendee #2]

Do you trust Claravale.

[Aajonus]

As you can see, I'm drinking out of their bottle, but this is the milk from Pennsylvania, the Amish milk?

[Attendee #2]

What they delivered to your house in California from Pennsylvania.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

We have a truck that brings it to us.

We're a buying club.

No one in Santa.

Rawsome was closed?

This is a private one.

[Attendee #2]

But this is the food, the milk that, all the food that's coming from Pennsylvania.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

[Attendee #2]

Is that private.

[Aajonus]

You can't go there and buy anything, you have to order online and then you go pick it up?

There's a pickup place.

[Attendee #3]

Also, the people that are doing this co-op, they're trying to minimize attention so the authorities don't get involved.

So if you join 'em, you have to be recommended because the word goes out and they could easily get busted, so there's a lot of precautions being taken.

[Attendee #2]

But there's a delivery down here on Saturday afternoon.

[Aajonus]

Every two weeks.

.

(2) Aajonus Body Fat, Body Fat Testing, Cooked Fat
(3) Activity Rings, Damage From Vegeatarianism
[2012],[Aajonus]

I you have a lot of activity rings in your eyes, that means you produce a lot of testosterone, estrogen, and adrenaline for physical activity

[Attendee]

I have like 5 - 7 of those.

[Attendee #2]

She's only got 5 - 7.

I think I had 11.

[Attendee]

Oh, did you.

Sometimes I feel energetic and that's a lot?

[Aajonus]

Well, no, you won't change.

You have that same amount, but sometimes you'll have the energy and the physical ability to be naturally 6 or 7 activity rings.

[Attendee #2]

If a person has activity rings, but they're not very robust and and more on the depressed side, like low energy.

What does that mean.

[Aajonus]

It means you were a vegetarian?

No, you fucked up your system.

It takes a long time to correct it.

The damage that vegetarianism does to the digestive tract and the whole body is tremendous.

[Attendee #2]

Well, I did vegetarianism for 10 years.

Because I lived in the tropics: I had coconut every day, I had avocados every day, I had a little bit of salad.

But the thing is, it was so hot and I didn't want to cook anymore.

I hated cooking.

But, that was it.

You know, I didn't need anything.

I had coconut every day.

[Aajonus]

Still not enough protein, coconuts, only 15% protein.

[Attendee #2]

I had coconuts every day, the jelly kind.

I had avocado.

[Aajonus]

Damages the whole digestive tract and all the energy system.

You weren't getting enough protein.

[Attendee #2]

So, although mentally there's a lot of activity, the body is in the healing proces, leansing process.

So, what do you do to sort of like, assist it?

[Aajonus]

Get high meat, high egg, rotten?

[Attendee #2]

Oh hell.

[Attendee #3]

She won't even take an egg that's not washed.

[Attendee #2]

No, the problem is I'm in the environment where you can't have that because like you'd be thrown out.

Okay, so high meat and high eggs.

[Aajonus]

You're living with people.

[Attendee #2]

Uh, yeah?

.

(4) Athlets Low Body Fat
[2012],[Aajonus]

A lot of these athletes go around with 7% body fat, like your marathon runners, 7% body fat

That's why they break down in their thirties.

[Attendee]

They have a heart attack running.

[Aajonus]

They had no cholesterol, all that shit.

That's what I mean.

The doctors are so full of crap.

[Attendee #2]

What does cholesterol do for the bod again.

[Aajonus]

Cholesterol is fat: cleans it, protect, it does everything?

[Attendee #2]

The cholesterol protects the body.

[Aajonus]

Protects the body?

It cleans it, gives it energy.

Without cholesterols, we wouldn't be alive.

.

(5) Butter On Plane
[2012],[Aajonus]

Without having enough butter and stuff, now I make sure I have enough butter with me

I take it up 30 - 50 pounds with me.

I take it through with me.

I have a letter from my doctor.

I tell them, "He's going to Asia.

He's been diagnosed with cancer.

The blood, bone, stomach and lymph.

He was diagnosed as diabetic".

This was 40 and 50 years ago see, but it doesn't say that when he was diagnosed.

[Attendee]

Oh, he got the same letter.

[Aajonus]

No, no.

What I'm saying, it's just that he was diagnosed with it, but it doesn't say when.

[Attendee #2]

I mean, if they look at you, then they shouldn't believe it.

[Aajonus]

will go through as if I was, I'll go through limping and crippled.

[Attendees],[Attendee #2]

Laughs

Won't they sell you butter.

What's wrong with Thai butter?

Can you buy butter in Thailand?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but it's not as good?

[Attendee #2]

No, but won't they tell you that.

[Aajonus]

No, cause they don't know?

They don't know you can get raw butter there.

No, it says on the letter raw butter.

What kind of cancer do you have.

[Attendee #2]

Won't they tell you, you can get raw butter here?

[Aajonus]

No, they don't know because it says in the letter, it's hard to find and get, and they don't provide it on the airplane.

So, I take two quarts of milk on with me.

When I go to Asia, it says in my doctor's letter, I take up to 50 pounds of butter, I take up to three quarts of milk sometimes, and then I have my honey, I take my meat.

[Attendee]

So, the liquid of milk, you can take that on a plane.

[Aajonus]

No, not unless you have a doctor's letter?

[Attendee #2]

On American airplanes, they don't stop you with these stuff.

[Aajonus]

Not with my letter?

[Attendee #2]

And what about the guy sitting next to you.

[Aajonus]

don't give a shit.

I've taken high meat and eating it right on the airplane.

Stinky stuff.

And there was a biologist that was writing a food contamination paper and I was eating it right in front of her.

The poor woman, she was like this.

She was, she was like this.

[Attendee #3]

I wrote my own letter.

Is that okay.

I just said I had cancer?

[Aajonus]

No, that's fine.

Once in a while, they'll call my doctor.

.

(6) Cellulite
[2012],[Attendee]

How get rid of the cellulite

[Aajonus]

Well, to get rid of cellulite?

Cellulite is old fat that is bound with toxin and it hardens.

It gets dehydrates cause its very toxic fats, so it hardens and hardens.

Then when you get rid of it the new fats come in and it cause it to swell up again gradually or quickly and then you'll see big clumps.

That's when the body starts dissolving it.

Then they have to pass it through the skin.

[Attendee]

Passes the cellulite through the skin, right wet.

Does it break down into a liquid.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

That's why you have to have the hot baths.

[Attendee]

That's how you get rid of your cellulite.

[Aajonus]

That's how you get rid of all the waste waste.

90% of the waste, the lymph system dumps under the skin to be perspired out the body, 90%.

Yeah.

[Attendee]

So, without the baths, your urine and feces doesn't get very rid very everything.

[Aajonus]

No?

Very small.

Well, they'll dump stuff out of the liver, the pancreas, the gallbladder, the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder, out of the urine and then out of the intestinal tract, but normally everything else moves out the skin.

[Attendee]

The body fat, the muscle.

[Aajonus]

Everything moves out the skin.

[Attendee]

Hot baths are so valuable.

[Aajonus]

Very, especially with all the hydrogenated vegetables and processed food we were raised on: cereal, donuts.

[Attendee]

You ate donuts.

[Aajonus]

Oh God?

I was donut-oholic.

[Attendee #2]

He was a pig when he was little.

[Aajonus]

I used to love those powder cake donuts and go through boxes.

[Attendee #2]

He wasn't born on the primal diet.

[Aajonus]

No, that's why I was supposed to die at 21.

I was very sickly.

[Attendee #3]

Did you gain your weight back after these injections.

Now you look pretty good?

[Aajonus]

Oh, I'm better.

[Attendee #3]

Do you have your weight back.

[Aajonus]

Not quite as much as I want?

When I left October 18th, I was 192 pounds, now I'm only 182, so I was 10 pounds more when I left last, but I'm putting it back on.

[Attendee #3]

Yeah, you look great.

[Aajonus]

I didn't go down as much this time I rationed my butter and drank more milk than I usually did.

[Attendee #3]

What did you get down to after that injection at your lowest.

[Aajonus]

I went down to probably 150?

[Attendee]

I can't keep my clothes; I have everything from a 2 to a 12.

[Aajonus]

Well, when I left when I was 92 pounds, I had a 36-inch waist.

So, I've got 34" - 37".

[Attendee]

That's not bad though.

That seems like a normal variance.

[Aajonus]

And then I've got 32", which will take me up to 33" and down a little bit.

I have 30" and 30" will take me down to as little as 29" and up to as highest 32".

[Attendee]

Like, I can't even get jackets on anymore, but I have muscle in my back and my arms and I dunno if it's muscle or fat I'm like, "What the hell, I've never had that".

[Aajonus]

Well, the belt size is the size that I really have to have three.

On these, I have two different sizes.

[Attendee]

Well see, this has never changed.

Is that part of getting older.

I'm gaining it in my arms, my back?

[Aajonus]

Well, wherever you have toxins for it.

he used to talk and I was too good up there.

[Attendee]

I can't put my jacket on laughs.

So I go, okay, I wanna lose this.

Is that appropriate.

[Aajonus]

If your body can melt the fats?

[Attendee]

And you know that by whether you get really toxic on the down diet.

How do you know that the down diet appropriate then?

[Aajonus]

Well, you shouldn't have symptoms on the down diet, especially rashes?

[Attendee]

Oh, you don't get nauseated or stuff.

[Aajonus]

Well, if you're eating that little bit of cheese?

[Attendee]

You shouldn't, because you are gonna dump toxins when you.

[Aajonus]

Most of it if you've taken the hot baths, it's supposed to go out the skin.

.

(7) Claravale
[2012],[Attendee]

So, you don't trust the Claravale

[Aajonus]

Claravale, there's nothing organic about it?

It's not organic.

[Attendee]

No, but they're natural, right.

[Aajonus]

No, they they feed them hay cuz there's no grass?

They don't have big pastures, very small pasture.

[Attendee #2]

It's just a good glass bottle.

[Aajonus]

Yes.

[Attendee #2]

So, he buys the milk, throws it.

[Aajonus]

No, I drank the milk cause I didn't have anything else.

There was no Organic Pastures, I didn't have anything else, but I drank it, but I keep the bottles.

Sometimes it's easier to suck outta this bottle.

.

(8) Cold Hands and Feet Is Mineral Deficieny. Cheese and Honey
[2012],[Attendee]

I have cold hands and feet all the time for many years

[Aajonus]

Severe mineral deficiency.

For about four or four days eat about a pound of cheese a day with about a half a cup of honey.

Half a cup of honey with a pound of cheese half a pound of cheese.

You mash 'em together.

You do that 3, 4 days in a row.

You can have it throughout the day.

You don't have to have it all at one time.

[Attendee #2]

You're gonna have eight ounces throughout the day with the half a cup of honey and that's for minerals.

[Attendee #3]

I have cold feet too, especially at night.

I wear sock on most days.

So, I need to do the same thing too.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

And that solved the problem for a long time.

[Aajonus]

It solved it for three or four weeks?

[Attendee #2]

To do that formula three to four days in a row.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

If that happens to me.

I only have to eat it one day, but I used to have 2, 3,4 days, usually three days, then it went down to two days.

Now it's one day.

[Attendee #2]

What happens if the the cheese is salted.

[Aajonus]

Salted, won't work?

.

(9) Cucumber Puree Important To Chew, Oil Pulling
[2012],[Aajonus]

hat's fine

But I'm saying you're still not gonna get the effect of the cucumber and tomato unless they're blended together.

Well, you might have a lot of, let's say dental anesthesia in here.

Sometimes the body needs to get it out of the salivary glands by chewing.

Well, you get a lot of bacteria.

The more you chew, the more bacteria you're going to get into your food.

You also get more toxins that are discharging from the brain out the salivary glands.

[Attendee]

How do you get more bacteria when you chew.

[Aajonus]

We have more bacteria in our bowels than dogs and cats?

[Attendee]

How do you get back to by chewing.

[Aajonus]

Your bacteria is in your part of your salivary gland?

[Attendee]

And so when you chewing you are getting rid of toxins from your brain when you're chewing.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, sometimes?

What I tell people do, if they have that kind of impulse is do some oil pulling, take some coconut oil and swish it around in the mouth and chew and keep it in there and spit it out after about 10, 15 minutes and then go ahead and chew all you want.

Keep it in your mouth.

Keep working until you pull all this stuff out, takes about 10, 15 minutes, you're chewing, hold it that sleuth.

Then if you go 12 hours, your gums may have filled up again.

[Attendee #2]

What does oil pulling do.

It pulls what out?

[Aajonus]

Chemicals out of your gums and salivary gland?

[Attendee]

So, you've got the coconut oil and you're kind of just swishing it around or you're kind of like also doing the chewing motion.

[Aajonus]

All of it, 10 - 15 minutes.

[Attendee #3]

So, when you do the nut formula and you take brain detox towards that, it's a binding.

The net formulas kinda.

[Aajonus],[Attendee #3]

I said if you have it too often

Oh, then it detoxes.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it can cause a brain detox.

Otherwise the nut formula just grabs excess hormone and some poisons.

[Attendee]

So, is it a good thing to detox the brain with the nut formula.

[Aajonus]

I don't think so?

[Attendee #3]

What is a good brain detox.

[Aajonus]

Putting hot water bottles at your head?

Cilantro.

They'll get down to your gland here.

Glands are supposed to take care of you, your lymph glands.

.

(10) Dairy Allergies
[2012],[Aajonus]

Well, I suggest that everybody does

People say, well, I have an allergy to it, this and this, and that happens.

I say, bear through it.

You know, you're not gonna get a better source of minerals and a better source of fat for the nervous system, unless you're having dairy.

So suffer through it, and then you'll get through it eventually.

[Attendee]

Because I get something, especially mentally, it's not working.

I mean, I get stoned, I get, I lose my memory.

[Aajonus]

You're getting a protein deficiency.

[Attendee]

No, by drinking milk.

[Aajonus]

You're getting a protein deficiency because you're using all the minerals to detox toxins out of the brain then you're not eating enough meat, eggs.

[Attendee]

No, I'm eating all the raw meat and eggs and all this.

But when I take milk- I'm doing sort of good, but every time I try milk, it's doing that.

[Aajonus]

How are you taking the milk.

[Attendee]

It's warm and I drink it without food?

Normally without food.

And I have another thing in my gut, I have very much discomfort as if I'm going to get diarrhea often.

[Aajonus]

Then you've got a lot of poisons and you need cheese.

You're eating the cheese regularly.

Small amount, like a sugar cube size, not a half teaspoon, and every 30 minutes you'll be able to drink the milk easily.

Right now your body's using all of the minerals in the milk and then without the minerals, you can't digest the fat properly, the cream.

Now, that can make your brain slow.

[Attendee #2]

I remember it took me a few years with the milk and then all of a sudden on few years on the diet, the milk was just like life saving.

It was like I wanted it.

Before I couldn't have any.

[Attendee]

When I start drinking milk, I can't stop.

I have a full craving for it and I can drink the whole pint.

[Aajonus]

Also eat some pineapple, about an inch and a half.

.

(11) Eating Rats
[2012],[Aajonus]

Oh, in Thailand if I catch the big rats, they eat them

I got a tractor finally to clear out some of the jungle and uncovered several big rats nests, big forest rats.

The dogs caught them and they eat them.

Not the dogs eat them, my workers eat them.

[Attendee]

Why do they like the rat meat.

[Aajonus]

Well, when you've got a big rat, it's pretty tasty and it's a wild rat?

It's not a city rat that eats garbage.

[Attendee #2]

How are things going over there in Thailand.

[Aajonus]

In Thailand, they have a raw meat dish, especially up around Shanghai, it's a regular thing that they have a raw meat dish?

I forgot what it's called, but they have a dish that they eat.

It's raw meat.

[Attendee]

What kind of raw milk do you get over there.

[Aajonus]

Best I can get?

[Attendee]

Is it buffalo.

[Aajonus]

No?

No.

Cow.

They imported a lot of cows, from New Zealand.

.

(12) Eating Schedule For Weight Loss
[2012],[Attendee]

I wanna lose some weight and I'm thinking that I haven't gone over the down diet in a long time and what's a good way to do it

And can you kind of go between the down diet and regular?

You go three days down, then eat a little bit more, and then go alternate.

[Aajonus]

Three days won't do it, you have to go on it four days.

[Attendee]

Oh, so tell me the whole of what you would suggest.

Now do you have different variations as well.

Cause I heard some different things for different people?

[Aajonus]

Yeah, it depends upon the individual, how they digest maybe myself.

Well, I usually don't do that personal stuff, but we don't have many people, so I'll do it.

[#1 1/4 teaspoon butter + 1/8 teaspoon honey + 1 - 1.

5 tablespoons cheese] First of all, awake in the morning, just make sure you've got the poisons out because I know you had medication.

So, eat some cheese first, probably only a pea sized amount of honey with it and bean sized amount of butter.

Put the butter and the honey together, it's a very small amount.

Don't put the cheese with the honey with the cheese directly.

The honey goes with the butter and then you eat that.

So, you have about 1/2 teaspoon of butter and honey mixture and then have that with a 1 - 1.

5 tablespoons of cheese to absorb the poisons.

[Attendee]

That much cheese.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

That's a lot of cheese.

[Aajonus]

If you're not going to digest it.

[Attendee]

Will the honey and the butter digest the cheese.

[Aajonus]

No, because the honey is so little?

You're only having a pea size amount of honey, it'll be mixed in the pea bean sized amount of butcher So, it's gonna be reacting with the butter.

That's just keep you from getting constipated if you're gonna on the weight loss.

[Attendee]

I'm not having problems.

[Aajonus]

But are you losing weight.

Because usually you won't lose weight if you're not going?

[Attendee]

I don't know.

I've lost a couple pounds.

[Attendee #2]

That 1/2 teaspoon of butter, honey.

[Aajonus]

I said 1/4 teaspoon of butter, 1/8th teaspoon of honey?

[Attendee #2]

No, but the thing is that combination of the butter.

If you're gonna eat that with the cheese, isn't that going too still digest it.

[Aajonus]

The honey has to react with the cheese?

If the honey is in the butter, it's not gonna react.

[Attendee]

So, then that's your first thing you do in the morning.

[Aajonus],[#2 Golf Ball Size of Patéed Meat]

Yeah?

And then about 15, 20 minutes after that, have a golf ball size of meat and if you want to make sure you lose the weight and you absorb all of meat, then paté the meat.

[Attendee]

So what about thinly slicing the meat, really grind it down.

[Aajonus]

If you don't grind it down, you're gonna have to produce a lot of hydrochloric acid?

It's gonna take your energy away from burning fat.

Cause all you need once it's patéed is the bacteria.

[#3 Sport Drink]

I think the sport drink is the good thing to drink, sip one all day long.

[Attendee]

Really.

What about the honey?

[Aajonus]

Well, just cut the honey down to a tablespoon and you lower the coconut cream to one tablespoon, dairy cream to one tablespoon, but you still put the eggs in it, 2 - 3 eggs?

[#4 1/2 Cup Milk Before Bed]

Well, I've always told people to have 1/2 cup of milk before you go to sleep on the down diet.

Ah, yeah.

It's in the book.

I also say sip milk throughout the day, but just don't drink a lot at one time.

[Large marble Size of Meat Every Hour (if not eating eggs)],[Egg Every Hour]

or

Then about every, let's say hour, you have maybe a large marble size if you don't have the egg, you have a large marble size amount of meat every hour.

If you're doing the eggs, have an egg every hour.

Well, you need the meat.

If you're having a small amount of meat, you need it all day long, a small amount all day long.

So, you have an egg one hour or every hour and a half.

You wait till you're hungry on the down diet.

Normally, I never wait til I'm hungry.

[Attendee]

I was gonna say, I'm not used to that.

So, what if you aren't hungry for three hours.

[Aajonus]

Well, three hours is okay, you don't go over five hours without meat?

[Attendee]

And if you're working out on the down diet, is that okay.

[Aajonus]

That's fine, just remember to sip the sport drink?

The book is regimented with bigger sizes of meat, golfball or meatball sizes of meat, 4 - 5 times a day and you're having juice.

But I found that juice makes people too hungry.

It can cause protein deficiency.

So, I think it just eggs and meat, a little bit of milk and sport formula.

But you wait till you're hungry each time.

[Attendee]

What if you like the juice.

Can you still do it?

[Aajonus]

Well, it's gonna make you hungrier, but you may need it?

You may need the green juice.

I would just cut it down to four ounces at a time.

[Attendee #2]

Why do you need the green juice.

[Aajonus]

Some people may need it cause they're over acidic?

[Attendee]

I think when I do this, I like doing beef because the beef gives you energy.

[Aajonus]

Oh, I eat mainly beef, except when I'm in Philippines, then I mainly eat fish cause I'm right there on the ocean.

[Attendee #2]

Do you still eat half white and red meat.

Yeah, you can do that?

That's where people were just getting on the diet.

People who were doing the diet for a little time.

It is better balance, but my body's pretty clean, except for these injections.

So, I can go on either meat, it's just if I'm on a down diet I'll eat the red meat.

[Attendee]

I'm repulsed by chicken for a year or two now.

That's all I ate before.

I don't know if it's the quality of the chicken.

[Aajonus]

Almost all your chickens are fed all processed.

[Attendee #2]

Why does the green juice make you hungry.

[Aajonus]

Well, it provides enzymes for digestive acids and then the body looks for foods to digest?

[Attendee]

So, stay on that four days, what'd you say to lose weight.

[Aajonus]

You have to stay over four days in a row to be consistent with it?

You could take three days off on something else, but I found you'll gain a lot of it back fast if you only do it three days.

[Attendee]

If I want to lose 40 pounds, just go on the down diet for 30 days straight.

[Aajonus]

That's what I do, yeah?

rid of it.

[Attendee]

So, you can go straight through it.

[Aajonus]

Yep.

[Attendee]

But if you feel like you're getting too intense detoxes, go back.

[Aajonus]

I would go back on to a regular diet if I didn't feel well?

So, how long would it take to lose weight.

[Attendee]

How much weight to lose in a week?

[Aajonus]

I can lose probably 8-10 pounds a week?

Other people don't lose it as fast cause they're healthy as I.

[Attendee]

So, if you have toxic fat, like I know there's cellulite now that came back, I never saw it before.

Like you said, it came pushed out to the outside.

That doesn't make you sick when you're coming on the down diet, all the toxins are gonna get released now, right.

[Aajonus]

Well, they're gonna get released through the skin, so you'll have rashes and hives and things like that?

(13) Fish Hungrier, Not Hungry After 3 Hours, Protein Deficiency, Pate Your Meat, Jar Cleaning
[2012],[Aajonus]

It depends upon the person

If I eat a lot of fish, I have to eat a tremendous amount.

I'm so hungry, just digests so quickly.

And for some people it isn't.

[Attendee]

Yeah, I get hungry quicker on fish for sure too.

[Attendee #2]

Why so.

[Aajonus]

You digest it quicker and easier?

[Attendee #3]

What if I eat agood amount of meat, sometimes I get really hungry just after it, like just after 15 minutes later as if I need more and more and more.

But if I don't eat, three hours later I won't be hungry at all for the same.

[Aajonus]

Because your body's eating your red blood cells.

[Attendee #2]

What does that mean.

[Aajonus]

Body's eating your red blood cells, not enough proteins, so the body starts eating red blood cells, himself?

Once you start eating your own blood cells, you become too acidic.

Meats repulsive.

[Attendee]

What's calling him to eat his own blood cells.

[Aajonus]

Protein Deficiency.

[Attendee]

Okay.

That was protein deficiency.

Can you say that again.

[Aajonus]

When you have a protein deficiency, your body starts eating its own red blood cells for protein?

[Attendee]

Why would I have a protein deficiency if I just had a meal.

[Aajonus]

You may already be protein deficient?

If you're very protein deficient, which I can see you are because your body wants a lot more mass on there.

The more muscle, the more fat you can store.

Right now, you don't have enough muscle.

.

All right, so when your body gets to meat, it says, oh, I like this.

Let's have more.

But you still have a digestive problem, so you've got a problem there, so you have to work that out.

You work that out by having a little honey and a little pineapple to help digestion, okay.

Of the meats?

Once you don't eat anything, then your blood protein level drops to a point where the body says, I have to eat my own red blood.

That causes a tremendous amount of overacidity and then that causes you to lose your appetite, cause of anorexia.

So, if you grind your meat all the way, you're not likely to get hungry, if you grind it into a paté.

If it's just normally ground, it's likely to be homogenized and it's not going to digest well and you're still gonna be hungry.

[Attendee]

It's not going to digest well because it's been grounded.

[Aajonus]

When it's grounded to a very fine paste, your body doesn't have to use any digestive acids, only bacteria is needed to infiltrate?

[Attendee]

Is that good.

[Aajonus]

Bacteria is 90% of digestion?

[Attendee]

Okay, but how do you make it like a fine paste.

[Aajonus]

Well, what I do is I take the steak and I'll cut it into cubes about 1" x 1", put it in my food processor, only fill my food processor halfway and then grind that in there until it's a paté?

And I'll make enough for 2 - 3 days sometime.

Stuff it in a two cup jar.

[Attendee #2]

Does it stay okay that way.

Better than leaving it whole?

[Aajonus]

About the same?

[Attendee #2]

It's a lot of work because I do it every day.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

I do it every 2 - 3 days.

[Attendee #2]

I don't have to wash the food processer so much.

[Aajonus]

Exactly.

It doesn't take much time to clean the food processor.

You figure we're getting pretty lazy when we've gone from hours of cooking and cooking and scrubbing pots to just a few minutes of cleaning your food processor.

This is the height of laziness.

[Attendee #2]

Almost an hour each day washing canning jars.

Well, that's a day's worth of canning jars usually takes me a an hour by the time I do every, well not quite an hour.

Maybe about 30 minutes.

[Aajonus]

To clean how many.

[Attendee #2]

Usually about 18 - 20, along with forks and tops every day and the food processor, and then the, the jars that you store your food in, you keep emptying them out so that they're part of the jars?

[Aajonus]

I clean as soon as I finish to get it outta the way.

[Attendee #2]

No, I can't do that cuz I'm eating this stuff on the road often, but also working.

I collect them, then I wash them once a day and use your special formula of coconut cream and apple cider vinegar and salt, it cleans much better.

And then that way I don't have to get hot water every, every time I need to do one jar, I get the hot water all at once.

It just makes a lot of sense, use a lot less water.

.

(14) Green Pastures Cod Liver Oil, Dit D In Dairy
[2012],[Aajonus]

Well, the cod liver, there's only one other cod liver oil that's good

I worked for them for two years to produce that awful, nasty, bitter tasting cod liver oil.

[Attendee]

Green Pastures.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, that's fermented, but it has no flavor to it?

Those that have flavoring is just processed oils that have been distilled and treated with kerosene.

So, you have to get the stinky, bitter one.

It's excellent.

If you're eating fish regularly and you're not eating junk food, this's not going to do anything benefit for you.

I tested on many, many people on this diet and there was no advantage.

If you're on a shit diet it will or you're not getting any sunshine.

[Attendee]

I took this oil and my head started shrinking like I had such headache and pain in my neck and everything.

Is that like allergies.

[Aajonus]

No?

Cleaning out the brain.

[Attendee]

So, I should take more.

[Aajonus]

I wouldn't do it?

I'd do it slowly.

[Attendee]

I should keep taking it slowly.

[Aajonus]

No, I'd just eat the diet and you will normally detox your brain slowly?

Yeah, I wouldn't eat that.

As long as you're on the diet, if you're, let's say 80% on the diet, I wouldn't eat any cod liver, unless you're eating something really nasty like fried foods.

[Attendee]

But if I'm in Canada and there's no sun and nothing.

[Aajonus]

It'll help, but your milk has a lot of vitamin d in it and your butter?

Oh, you can't get it at all.

[Attendee #2]

You can't go to a farmer?

[Attendee]

I can take my car and go two hours in Vermont?

The quality I had there was not that good.

It was tough.

There was no cream.

(15) High Meat To Build Up Bacteria, High Meat
(16) Honey Weight Gain From Enzymes
[2012],[Aajonus]

You digest more food

[Attendee]

I'm having more honey to digest more food.

[Aajonus]

Yes?

Digest more food with honey, honey's enzymes.

[Attendee]

No, but I'm saying why am I putting weight on by eating the honey.

[Aajonus]

Just what I said?

You're digesting more food, you're digesting more fats.

Everything you put it.

[Attendee]

No, but I'm saying I'm eating extra honey, so I'm putting more weight on.

Not from the honey.

[Aajonus]

You're digesting the other foods better because you're eating so much, honey?

[Attendee]

Oh, I see.

So, if I eat, if I less honey, do you think I'd lose the weight.

[Aajonus]

Not necessarily?

[Attendee #2]

I tried that, It doesn't work.

[Attendee]

Okay.

So, the food that I'm eating, I'm using it more.

So, therefore I'm putting weight on because of the food.

(17) Hot Water Bottles, Muscle Recipe
(18) Ideal Body Fat
[2012],[Attendee]

Below 20% body fat

[Aajonus]

Well for women, I say don't go below 23% - 24%.

[Attendee]

Wow.

Okay.

The doctor would tell you 15%.

[Attendee #2]

What about a man.

[Aajonus]

They say men, anywhere from 10% - 12%?

I keep mine at least 20% - 21.

% Couple of times I've gone down to 18%.

.

(19) Juice Fast, Weight Loss, Ideal Weights
[2012],[Attendee]

Because so many of the detoxes I did before the Primal Diet were like juice fasting, so you would all get sick the first few days

[Aajonus]

I'm never a juice faster.

I don't tell anybody to juice.

[Attendee]

Well, I did that before I met you.

[Aajonus]

Well, what happens on a juice fast is you keep getting lower on fat and protein.

Then when you are hungry, you just start overeating and then right back where you were.

[Attendee]

Is it okay to lose 20 or 30 pounds.

[Aajonus]

You could use lose 20, 30 pounds?

That'd be all right.

[Attendee]

Because you're getting rid of the old stuff, that's fine.

You don't have to repeat everythig and gain it.

How many times do you tell a person has to go up and down?

[Aajonus]

Just in the recipe book?

I told everybody to do it every six months because a lot of people are paranoid that they had to wait a long time, they'd start worrying about it every day, but if they know they lose it every six months and they won't worry about it.

But I like to tell people who are confident and don't worry about it.

Let's stay there for two and a half years and then let the body go into a flue and take it off.

Don't force it.

So, I never had to force mine.

What's the first time ever really.

[Attendee]

So, it's okay also just to carry it forever even?

[Aajonus]

Absolutely?

[Attendee]

I guess I thought the purpose of a down diet was to detox.

[Aajonus]

You're going have certain fats that bind certain poisons while they're moving out of the body.

When I went back to Asia that last time I had holes.

Well, you never saw me sitting without a shirt on.

I don't go shirtless when I look like that.

[Attendee]

You has that washboard belly like about two years ago you took your shirt off at the potluck.

[Aajonus]

That's when I'm on my thin side, but when I'm on my full side and I'm full.

It's amazing.

[Attendee #2]

You don't look like 180 now.

[Aajonus]

I'm 182.

[Attendee]

So, are you gonna do the down diet with me.

[Attendee #3]

Yeah, you'll be skin and bones if you go down?

[Attendee]

I need to lose at least, 10 - 15.

I'd say about 15 pounds.

So, I'm 150.

[Aajonus]

And how tall are you.

[Attendee #2]

I think I'm 5' 5"?

And I just said, whose bottom is that.

[Attendee #3]

Did you say 150?

[Attendee #2]

Yeah?

[Attendee #3],[male]

You're more than me .

[Attendee #2]

I think I've been having too much honey in my formulas.

I think I need to reduce the honey.

[Aajonus]

But still, 5' 5", you shouldn't be under 140.

[Attendee]

So, what's a good one for 5' 4".

[Aajonus]

About 135 minimum?

[Scott]

What about 5' 10".

[Aajonus]

For a guy, you should be up to almost 200 pounds?

[Attendee]

He's got 50 pounds to go.

[Scott]

But I've never been able to put any weight in my whole life.

[Attendee]

Have you been doing the dairy.

[Scott]

Yeah?

[Attendee #2]

You'll start putting it on long.

No, when he gets closer to the 6th and 7th year, he'll start putting.

Because I never put it on and all, all of a sudden it's like, I have big fat and I just put it on now.

[Attendee]

Does turning 50 have a part.

[Attendee #2]

Not the 50, just the menopause?

[Aajonus]

If you're on a shit diet.

[Attendee]

But your metabolic weight slows down too, right.

[Aajonus]

No, they just have so many toxins collecting at that age, when they go into menopause, the body needs to detoxify?

[Attendee]

So, it holds fat.

[Aajonus]

It's collecting the fat because it's not dumping the poisons, but you go to keep going into heat flashes to perspire it out, but those heat flashes don't work very much?

[Attendee]

It's not really the hormones fluctuating.

[Aajonus]

It's the toxins trying to get rid of the toxins and putting them out the skin?

[Attendee]

So, the hormones though are gonna come lower, right.

[Aajonus]

No, you're still building as many, you're making as many?

You're just using it to attach to toxins cause hormones are 60% fat or more, 68% fat.

So, your body uses the hormones to bind with the poisons, so it isn't you.

Just because you find a lower ratio of them in your blood that doesn't mean you're not making a lot of them.

See, all they find, "Oh, it's lower in the blood, therefore your body's not making the hormones", and it's a lie.

The body's using it because now the liver's breaking down, it's not making the fats properly to harness with the toxins to feed the lymphatic system to clean the body, so the body starts using its hormones for purpose.

[Attendee #2]

Why would the body, in my case, put on weight because of the honey.

[Aajonus]

Well, you were able to digest and?

(20) Milk Clubs In Canada

(21) Milk Okay With High Meat, Coconut Cream With High Meat
[2012],[Aajonus]

It doesn't work as well

Coconut cream will destroy.

Honey will destroy it too.

You can wash it down with milk.

[Attendee]

You have to eat it as just honey.

And then you rinse your mouth with milk and spit out the milk.

You've gotta meat as it is.

[Aajonus]

No, you can take the milk down a little bit.

Alittle bit slower than digestion.

[Attendee #2]

If you rinse the chicken, does that make it no longer high chicken.

[Aajonus]

Well, you're not gonna have all the outer bacteria?

[Attendee #2]

That's a good way to work into it, right.

[Attendee]

No, my thing is I've gotta be in an environment where I don't have people, that's the problem?

.

(22) Muscle Pain, Lactic Acid
[2012],[Attendee]

And that's for the muscle

What about the joints.

[Aajonus]

That would be a constant pain, not just cramping?

[Attendee]

Yeah?

Constant pain.

[Aajonus]

Bone marrow.

[Attendee]

How much.

[Aajonus]

About two ounces of bone marrow?

[Attendee]

Throughout the day.

[Aajonus]

No, all at once?

You're always trying to second guess what I'm going to say.

[Attendee]

Sorry.

[Aajonus]

Stop and listen.

[Attendee]

Alright.

[Aajonus]

So, 2 oz of bone marrow with about 2 oz of butter and about a teaspoon of pineapple juice.

You take a chunk of pineapple and squeeze a tablespoon of juice from that.

And if it's real bad, while you're eating that, take a slice and put it over that joint very thin, and then cover that with a moist gauss and cover that with a piece of plastic and then put a H-bandage around it and you put a hot water bottle or two next to that joint at night.

[Attendee]

Connective tissue.

[Aajonus]

Hot baths, and whey?

Also any of the sport drinks.

[Attendee]

So, how does the sport drink work, its benefit.

What is it about the sport drink?

[Aajonus]

Depends on what you use in it?

[Attendee #2]

So, the one you gave us last time, is that just the standard.

[Aajonus]

No, I'm saying it depends on what you use in it and the different combination?

[Attendee]

Yeah.

See, because the combinations, there's the standard, which is just the tomato, cucumber, and all the other stuff.

That's the standard.

Then there's the other one is, watermelon, and cucumber.

[Aajonus]

And tomato.

That's what I mean.

You can use any.

So, you can have like eight combinations or more.

[Attendee]

So, is the sport drink for dryness or.

[Aajonus]

It's for a lot of things?

[Attendee]

Well, give us a few things.

[Aajonus]

Well, it helps rehydrate the body cause you can absorb 100% of the H20 in all different types of tissue if you have tomato and the cucumber together.

If you have watermelon, that's gonna have a tendency to cleanse and hydrate the intestines more, and mucus membrane and the connective tissue.

If you have whey and cucumber, it like would be mostly joints and connective tissue, and it will clear lactic acid from the muscles.

Lactic acid, byproduct of metabolism.

Whey and tomato be joints also, also nerves.

[Attendee]

With all the other stuff too or just those.

[Aajonus]

No, just two?

These are the different ones.

Let's say you add two cups of tomato, one cup of whey, or 1.

5 cups of tomato and 1.

5 cups of way.

.

(23) Nausea, Vingar, Sports Drink
[2012],[Aajonus]

Nausea is almost always the process of something going into the stomach, whether you're eating it or whether it's coming from the body, dumping into the stomach, body forms hydrochloric acid to neutralize those poisons

If those are not neutralized, you have to vomit them.

If you have something in there to help neutralize that besides hydrochloric acid, vinegar helps.

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

So, whatever combination you have in the sports drink, when you add a little bit of apple cider vinegar to it, it just assists the-

That's why I have always have vinegar in there, depending upon the person.

Sometimes I'll recommend people have two tablespoons, but most always it's just one tablespoon and that dispersed through the whole quart even and enough to take care.

However, most of the time I say if you have nausea, you eat cheese to absorb the poisons.

Don't worry about neutralizing, absorb them, so you'd be sure they don't get recycled.

[Attendee #2]

What's the difference between eating cucumbers and tomatoes by themselves.

[Aajonus]

Oh, it's a huge difference?

[Attendee #2]

So, when you get to that point where you know what you want, does that mean you know what you're doing to some extent with your body.

[Aajonus]

Well, if you get the results you want, yes?

If you're not getting the results you want, then no.

[Attendee #2]

Well, I don't know what I'm doing, I just know good body wants it and it feels good after I eat it.

[Aajonus]

That's why I say you gotta read the books, sometimes you don't know remember.

Well, I talk about all those things in the book.

[Attendee]

So, what does eating the cucumbers and tomatoes, compared to blending to do.

[Aajonus]

Well, when you blend them together, you've got a formula that will disperse evenly all over and do the same thing?

[Attendee #2]

Is that better.

[Aajonus]

Yes, it is?

When you're eating them separately, you're gonna have isolated things, getting certain areas.

.

.

.

(24) No Lemon With Red Meat
(25) Over Acidic Blood
[2012],[Aajonus]

Your blood protein drops to the point where your body has to eat its own red blood cells to get the protein and that causes over acidity and nausea, which is anorexia

[Attendee]

And to get rid of the acidity and the nausea.

[Aajonus]

Vegetable juice is helpful for that, some fruit?

[Attendee]

Which fruit.

[Aajonus]

Any of the fruit?

[Attendee]

How.

[Aajonus]

Alkanizing substances?

[Attendee]

Like eat just fruit by itself or in the mixture with cow cream and coconut.

[Aajonus]

Any way you want?

[Attendee]

Okay.

And then when the over acidity is neutralized with the vegetable juices and fruit, then he slowly gets back into trying to eat the meat to build up the system.

[Aajonus]

Well, if you just have the pineapple, that should do it.

[Attendee]

It'll neutralize the acidity.

[Aajonus]

Neutralize the acidity, and keep digestingthe meat at the same?

[Attendee #2]

Lemon.

[Aajonus]

Not with red meat.

(26) Sipping Milk Throughout Day, Cream Hard To Digest, Not Digesting Meat, Cooked Mea,t Hydroclhoric Acid
[2012],[Attendee]

I usually drink 8 ounces when I drink it

[Aajonus]

I only do maybe two ounces at a time.

Then I do that about every 30 minutes.

[Attendee #2]

Didn't you say sipping milk throughout the day has some benefit.

[Aajonus]

You digest it better; your body handles it better?

No backup, there's no slow down.

Yeah.

So, what I do is I sip about 1 oz, 1.

5 - 2 oz at a time.

Then I do that about every 30 minutes.

[Attendee #2]

And what's the benefit of that.

What was that specific?

[Aajonus]

I just had said, it digests better?

You handle everything better, easier.

Nothing backs up.

nothing is overloaded.

Yeah.

What happens.

It's the overload, right?

[Attendee #2]

So, what happens, I remember in the past when Joseph and I were talking about milk?

Every time I drink you the milk, whether it's the six ounces of the eight ounces or more, I get sleepy.

So, why does it make you sleepy.

[Aajonus]

Because the cream is very difficult to digest, especially when it's mixed with the other milk?

[Attendee #2]

So, you kind of shut down.

[Aajonus]

Well, your body just has to spend all this energy on digestion?

[Attendee]

I just got sleepy from having a little tiny bit of cheese.

[Aajonus]

That's unusual.

[Attendee #2]

It could be just that time of the day, the afternoon's that time, especially with this weather, you just wanna cuddle up and go to sleep.

[Scott]

Is it okay to drink milk with food.

Do you have milk with food, or should you have it separate?

[Aajonus]

If you have milk with food, it should be a very small amount?

[Scott]

Always sip it.

[Aajonus]

Better, yeah?

When I have a meat meal, I'll have a tablespoon to rinse my mouth, but I won't touch it for another 20 -30 minutes.

[Attendee]

So, drink milkshakes the same way.

Two ounces at a time?

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

It's always better.

2 oz at a time every 10, 15 minutes or every 5 minutes, you do two ounces every 5 minutes of a milkshake.

Unless you want to take a long time to drink it, take an hour to drink it that's okay.

If you have, let's say a 16-ounce milkshake, then over a period of an hour, if you had two ounces at a time.

[Attendee]

So, if you drink that all at once, that's way too much.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

I mean if you have milkshake all one time like that,I would just go to sleep.

[Attendee]

I can have eight ounces all at one time, but not sixteen.

[Attendee]

So, in that hour, you're sipping that milkshake and nothing else.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

[Attendee]

What was, what was your question for Aajonus.

[Scott]

It was about milk?

[Attendee]

Well, take advantage.

[Attendee]

Okay.

Like when you eat raw meat, what would be a good portion.

[Aajonus]

How much meat at a time?

[Attendee]

Yeah?

[Aajonus]

I usually have 1/2 pound, 1.

5 cups.

[Attendee]

That's a lot.

[Attendee]

Didn't say something about ground up meat oxidizes or something.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends on how it's ground?

If it's ground under high pressure the fat is homogenized and then homogenized fat encapsulates the protein and you don't digest it very well.

[Attendee]

I feel like I digest the ground beef better.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but usually stores grind it through a high-pressure grinder twice.

[Attendee]

But I feel how often when I eat meat, it stays in my stomach more than cooked meat

Which I find strange because I should be able to digest it.

[Aajonus]

Just means you have no hydrochloric acid in your stomach.

[Attendee]

Then what do you do.

[Aajonus]

See, when you have cooked meat, it'll just flake off and fall apart and dissolve?

In your intestine, raw does not, unless you have hydrochloric acid.

[Attendee]

How do you get that.

[Aajonus]

Beets, corn, pineapple?

[Attendee]

Beets have hydrochloric acid.

[Aajonus]

They hydrochloric acid precursors?

[Attendee]

So, eating raw meat won't give this hydrochloric acid.

[Aajonus]

Well, it depends on how toxic your stomach lining is, sounds like your stomach lining is pretty dark?

[Attendee]

It's pretty bad.

[Attendee]

So, if he eats pineapple with his meat, how much pineapple.

[Aajonus]

Not much?

[Attendee]

Pineapple makes me swell, like my mouth.

[Attendee]

Mine even bled once.

[Aajonus]

Yeah.

Well, you're only supposed to eat a small piece at a time.

Mine will last two weeks.

What you do is you cut it in circles like this, small circle.

And then you put it down in a bowl, so it's down in a bowl like this and it seats itself and it stays fine.

Well, when you take it out, let's say you've gone three days without having any.

You take about a 16th of an inch slice off, throw it away, and take your slice off of that.

[Attendee]

But that's still a lot.

If you take a slice like that, there's still a lot of pineapple on there.

[Aajonus]

Oh, that's too much.

It's a small, I'm not saying that thick.

Let's say you're taking a slice off, okay, to get a cube of pineapple like that.

You just take a thin slice about an 1/8" and that's all you eat.

[Attendee]

It could be there forever.

[Aajonus]

Not if you're doing that two, three times a day, even four times a day, taking a little thin slice for.

When I used to go to the movie theater I would take high chicken with me

The reason I did is cuz everybody was using these perfumes and colognes with formaldehyde in it and I couldn't go into a movie theater anymore.

If I wanted to go to movie theater, I would take my chicken legs and I mean, they would rank, I'd leave them out the day before.

They were already high in the refrigerator and they would just be so bad.

I like the smell and I would pull that out and you just, two rows in front, all the way on the side and two rows in back, clear out.

Well, I was reported one time.

[Attendee]

We're supposed to buy the stuff that's in the movie now, $6 for a little candy bar .

(29) Termites
[2012],[Aajonus]

I would tape all the doors on the inside, but the last one you go out

I would tape that one after I go out.

[Attendee]

How serious is termite killing medication, what does it do.

[Aajonus]

If the body decides to throw it there, body puts it in a non weak place, then it won't be so bad?

And if you have fats there, it's not gonna be so bad.

And if you put it in a weak place or a place where it's very fat deficient, It's gonna have some damage that kills cells that cause more toxicity in the area that can damage every cell, every time that it offgases.

[Attendee #2]

I looked up the cedar oil once and it seems to me that there was two kinds, one water based or oil based.

Have you ever seen anything like that.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, there's a water based one?

[Attendee #2]

Which ones should I be buying.

[Aajonus]

I would buy the oil based one?

They say neither has any VOCS in it, volatile organic compounds in any Cedar product, however, I tried the water soluble one and usually oil is more toxic, more compounds in it.

But the water soluble one seemed to give me a headache, and the oil soluble one did not.

And the water soluble one lasted for weeks.

Oil soluble one, because I think it was absorbed better into the wood, it only lasted about three or four days.

[Attendee #2]

You mean the order.

[Aajonus]

Odor can still be heavy?

Cause those are still oil vapors.

[Attendee #2]

So, the water, the water vapor lasted a lot longer, is that what you said.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Cause there was some other chemical in it, that chemical was not a good chemical.

(30) Thai Women and Prostitutes
(31) Types Of Clay To Eat, Fast Metabolism and Leaky Gut
[2012],[Attendee]

Recommending Terramin Clay or Terrasilk Clay for eating

[Aajonus]

Depends upon the individual?

If they have a high metabolism and they're an athlete, they should be eating Terramin.

They're very slow, low energy.

Barbara Morgan is a high energy person, she should not be having the Terrasilk.

[Attendee #2]

What's the difference.

[Aajonus]

One coarser than the other?

Terrasilk is very fine.

[Attendee]

It's a lot more expensive too.

[Attendee #2]

So, the Terrasilk being fine is for the people with low energy.

[Aajonus]

Slow digestion?

[Attendee #2]

Slow digestion, how does that affect- I'm trying to understand what the difference is.

[Aajonus]

Well, the people who are slower digestion need a finer molecule to help pull stuff out of the blood out of the intestine.

The people who have a high metabolism where everything is moving fast, they need a more coarse one, or else they may absorb some of those fine toxic molecules.

Clay is a rock.

It's not a substance, it's not a food.

[unclear] gets absorbed into the body.

If you're a hyperactive person, then you've got a high metabolism.

[Attendee #3]

What if you're both.

[Aajonus]

If you're both, then you could use either?

[Attendee #2]

So, when you are on the low end, then you should be having the silk.

[Aajonus]

Right?

[Attendee #2]

And the thing is, if you eat the wrong kind and it's absorbing in your body, it's going to be damaging you.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

It'll be heavy metal toxicity.

Rock does not digest in the human body and, but sometimes, because I tell you to soak it and leave it a long time, you've got bacteria in there that will break it down even further to just help pull poisons out faster.

But some people who have high metabolism have huge pores in their intestines, and even those things can pass out.

It'll never get into a cell, but it can get into the blood, it can get into the neurological fluid and cause complication.

It could cause rashes, it could cause nausea, it could cause headaches, loss of appetite, too much hunger; can go anyway.

(32) Used To Go To The Bathroom More, Vegetarians Not Digesting, Toxins In Food
[2012],[Attendee]

I remember when I was a lot leaner, I was always going to the bathroom

[Attendee #2]

Yeah, me too.

I don't go as much anymore.

I don't go as much anymore.

[Aajonus]

When I was a fruitarian, Vegetarian I'd do five or six times a day.

Now on Primal Diet, one time a day, sometimes one time every two days.

[Attendee #2]

Or just having a bowel movement too.

Is that part toxicity every hour.

[Aajonus]

If it's a diarrhea, that's toxicity?

But if they're going every hour, the body's not digesting their food and something in their food like a food coloring or a fragrance that goes into a food, make it smell good, any of those can be highly toxic.

Cause them to have regular bowel movements several times a day.

[Attendee #2]

So, when you started assimilating, all of a sudden your food is digesting, is that cause the organs are healthier.

[Aajonus]

Bacteria's high in the intestines?

[Attendee #2]

All the bacteria or specific bacteria.

[Aajonus]

All of it?

[Attendee]

How does the bacteria get high.

[Attendee #2]

Yeah?

How do you increase.

So, now why are we having more bacteria?

[Aajonus]

Because you're not taking all the poisons and also you're eating the cheese regularly?

You're absorbing poisons so they don't damage of the colon.

[Attendee #2]

Did you talk about it in that class.

[Aajonus]

No, because I didn't understand all of it at that time and now of course I give the lectures different?

Eat the cheese that will absorb every hour, every 30 minutes, depending on how toxic the person lives.

Eat a little piece of cheese, get a train of it going through to collect the poison sand that will prevent the toxins from lowering the bacterial levels.

[Attendee #2]

Oh, so the toxins lower the bacteria levels.

[Aajonus]

They kill bacteria?

[Attendee #2]

Right.

And eating the cheese throughout the day raises the bacteria in the gut.

[Aajonus]

Only because it grabs onto the poisons?

[Attendee #2]

And what are the poisons specifically.

[Aajonus]

Depends on what they are?

If you're eating processed food, like I said, it could be anything from any additive: could be coloring, it could be flavoring, it could be a fragrance.

like a lot of the stuff that smells like strawberries.

It's not at all strawberry anything, it's actually ester chemical that they made from petroleum.

So, those kind of things get into the system, get into the tissue, and even if you're not eating them now, they were in your body.

When your body throws 'em off, dissolves the fat that they were harnessed in or encapsulated in, sets them free again, they can poison all the bacteria in the intestine.

And if it's really toxic, your body will either vomit or have diarrhea to get rid of it.

If you have the cheese going through regularly, small amounts of the cheese going through regularly, it collects those poisons as long as you don't eat the honey directly with the cheese, and as long as it's raw, no salt cheese.

[Attendee #3]

So, just everybody to eat small pieces of cheese all the time during the day.

[Aajonus]

Yeah?

Yeah.

[Attendee #3]

I've never found them cheeses.

[Aajonus]

Well, Amos Miller and some of those Amish farmers that have on their product list willl actually ship them to.

You have to do a FedEx, you can't do it post office.

(33) Weight Gain and Loss and Aajonus Height, Detoxing Without Extra Fat
[2012],[Attendee]

To assist, you put on the extra 10, 15 pounds

Then when you are detoxing, whether it's with the cilantro juices or whatever formulas you give, you're supposed to in that day, eat the butter, the cheese, the cream, the coconut cream.

[Aajonus]

Daily.

[Attendee]

Is that the formula.

[Aajonus]

15 pounds I would say is minimum?

I like people to go 20, 25 pounds.

If they're over 5' 4", they should be going 20 pounds overweight.

My bottom is about 163 lbs now, but I'll go all the way up to 192.

So, I go 30 pounds.

[Attendee #2]

What's your height.

[Aajonus]

5' 7" 3/4?

" I've been 5' 7" 3/4" since I was 16.

5 years old.

All my family is shrunken and shrunken and shrunken, I've stayed.

The last time I did it I was actually 1/16th of an inch taller.

So, I'm just slightly above the 5' 7" 3/4".

[Attendee]

How did you get the extra height.

[Aajonus]

I think that I just started growing?

[Attendee]

Okay.

[Aajonus]

If you don't have a reserve, you're gonna have a lot more symptoms, you're gonna suffer more and you're not gonna get very well.

You're not gonna detoxify properly and you're gonna damage tissue in your body.

[Attendee]

So, that extra cushion of fat absorbs the toxicity.

[Aajonus]

Correct?

[Attendee]

Okay.

So, is that why back then when I was detoxing and I didn't have the extra fat on, that it went into the bone marrow.

[Aajonus]

Yeah, but it probably went into other cells, not just the bone marrow?

[Attendee]

What other cells.

[Aajonus]

Any cells in your body where the poison went?

[Attendee]

The toxicity went in the cells, like you talking about like the liver maybe.

[Aajonus]

Depends on where it was coming out and what was the local site.

If it came out of the liver, it may go right back into the liver.

Other cells that had fat, but it would be looking for the fat inside the cell, so it would go into the cell and destroy the fat inside the cell, so then the cell is weaker or even dies, or is maimed in some way.

So, that cell won't function anymore.

That's why it's very important to have excess fat.

[Attendee]

So, in the bone marrow of the body, that's where the red white blood cells are made and get their energy.

[Aajonus]

They divide in the bone marrow, they mature in the bone marrow, and then once they mature they enter the bloodstream?

[Attendee],[Aajonus]

So, if they enter the bloodstream, immature, not with enough oxygen, then you're going-

You're red blood cells take oxygen from the lungs and take them to the cells, but when a cell is bred in a toxic bone marrow, it's going to be affected.

It's not going to be as strong, let's say that it's a red blood cell, it won't be able to carry as much to oxygen, it'll have a lot more toxic byproducts that it excretes.

Then the white blood cells are supposed to eat all of that.

If they're toxic, they're gonna get nauseous and they can't eat as much, so they won't be able to keep the blood as clean.

[Attendee #2]

After the down diet, does your body hurt from toxicity.

[Aajonus]

Depends on how far down you go?

I've seen people go beyond where they're supposed to go.

Let's say they've been 15 pounds overweight and they go below the 15 pounds, they're gonna have some problems.

[Attendee #2]

Now, when you say overweight, like you said 5' 4", is that according to the primal diet weight.

[Aajonus]

It would be what the typical chart would say?

Typically someone who is 5' 4" the average weight would be 123 lbs.

.

(34) Whey
[2012],[Attendee]

What is special about the whey

Cause there must be something special about it cause it's in the sports drinks?

[Aajonus]

Well, it has a tendency to turn vinegar and will be more cleansing, can help dissolve mineral buildups, it can help dissolve lactic acid buildups, crystallizations.

[Attendee #2]

What if you don't want it in there, is that okay.

[Aajonus]

Don't use it?

It's okay.

Like I said, you can use four different things, you don't have to have whey at all.

You have watermelon, tomato and cucumber.

You could have cucumber and tomato, you could have watermelon and tomato, you could have watermelon and cucumber.

[Attendee #2]

Sometimes a food repulses me.

So, is that not a normal instinct to pick the right thing.

[Aajonus]

Well, maybe something that you know is going to detox you too fast?

[Attendee #2]

Something better smelling or tasting.

[Aajonus]

Then you need to put something in at the counteract that, that's usually with the vinegar?

[Attendee #3]

What does that mean.

Vinegar counteracts the detoxing?

[Aajonus]

No?

It helps take care of the detoxing, so it isn't extreme.

It will help neutralize poisons to the point where they don't make you so Ill.
