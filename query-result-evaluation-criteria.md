# Relevance Criteria for Test Set Scoring

When scoring a test set, I tried to consider the following criteria to ensure objective and consistent relevance judgments:

## Topic Alignment
- The result must **directly address the topic** of the query.
- For a query like "Child genius," results should specifically discuss child prodigies or exceptional intellectual abilities.

## Information Need
- The result should fulfill the **implicit or explicit information need** behind the query.
- If the query implies seeking examples, relevant results should provide those examples.

## Completeness
- The result should provide a **complete answer** to the query, minimizing the need for further searching.

## Authority
- The source of the result should be **credible and authoritative** on the subject matter.

## Currency
- For queries where the **recency** of information is important, consider the date of publication or update in the relevance scoring.

## Context and Nuance
- Ensure the result is not just mentioning the query terms but is **actually about the query topic**.
